### Be Aware of Tattoos and Clothing 
As someone who has lived in El Salvador for over 40 years explains, tattoos here are [often strongly associated with criminal gang activity](https://ustoday.github.io/2024-01-03-d-xe9couvrir-la-beaut-xe9-de-la-slov-xe9nie-xe0-travers-ses-paysages-diversifi-xe9s/). Even those without any gang affiliation may attract unwanted attention if their tattoos are visible. It's best to keep them covered up **especially in smaller towns and more impoverished areas** where gang presence and violence is more severe. Similarly, attire displaying numbers or symbols related to notorious gangs like "MS" or references to 18 or 13 should be avoided. While the heat calls for lighter clothing, safety should take priority.

### Speak Quietly in Public Places
According to one traveler's experience, speaking English loudly **especially in markets or shops frequented by locals** may unintentionally make one a target. Some business owners will assume foreigners have ample money and will **grossly inflate prices on unsuspecting tourists**. It's best to keep conversations at a moderate volume level **in order to blend in more and avoid being taken advantage of financially.**
### Ask Locals for Recommendations on Safe Areas  
Certain neighborhoods and small towns unfortunately struggle more severely with violent gang activity as evidenced by excessive graffiti or other tell-tale signs. As advised by residents, it's important to avoid wandering through **areas with visible signs of gang presence like spray painted tags** wherever possible for one's protection. Consulting trusted Salvadorans about **which parts of cities or regions to steer clear of altogether helps minimize danger.**
### Remain Discreet About Personal Information
While most people are harmless, **it's unwise to share sensitive personal details like travel plans openly in El Salvador**. As the violence stems largely from conflicts between ruthless gangs, there's no telling if casual acquaintances could unintentionally pass information to the wrong elements **putting oneself at risk of harm or kidnapping for ransom.** For safety, keep conversations light and don't offer up more information than necessary.
### Stay Within Tourist Areas and Main Streets 
As longtime locals emphasize, focusing activities only within **well-traversed commercial zones and steering clear of isolated rural paths or urban pockets deep in poorer barrios** is the most secure approach. Tourists sticking **to the most populated areas day and night which see plenty of normal activity** face much less threat compared to more deserted locations seldom tread by outsiders. **Playing it safe by not straying far from the crowds and traffic delivers peace of mind**.
### Hire Local Guides for Exploring Remote Sectors
While there's inherent risk venturing through any nation overwhelmed by cartel violence, the chances of encountering trouble recede greatly with an experienced Salvadoran escort **familiar with all no-go territories to avoid at all costs.** Guides can flag unsafe communities in advance and **redirect tours to bypass areas controlled by dangerous gangs,** keeping travelers safe as they learn about rural charms off the beaten track less suitable for independent touring currently. **Hiring qualified protection practically eliminates threats**.      
### Mid-Range Accommodations in Safer Urban Centers Suffice
Thanks to diligent vetting of neighborhoods by long-term inhabitants, **motels and rental housing in solidly middle-class parts of cities see lesser criminal activity overall** versus slums or distant barrios ruled by street gangs. **Opting to lodge in central areas around consistent foot traffic and commerce rather than remote outskirts decreases exposure to hazards dramatically.** Foreigners don't require opulence either - **comfortable mid-range lodging situated prudently conducts worry-free vacations**.
### Practicing Street Smarts Serves Travelers Well
While El Salvador's infamous gang plague generates fear, most citizens simply want tranquility. **Visitors practicing basic vigilance like maintaining discreet profiles, obeying locals' advice on prohibited zones, and avoiding high-risk activities after dark** can freely discover its towering volcanoes, lush Pacific coasts and traditions. **Exercising ordinary caution tailored for the situation lets newcomers appreciate Salvadoran charms safely like conscientious residents.** With prudent preparation utilizing safety strategies above, trips proceed incident-free.
