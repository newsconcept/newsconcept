### The Fate of Digital Wii U Purchases Remains Unclear
While Nintendo has allowed the transfer of certain digital Wii purchases to the Wii U in the past, the company has not confirmed if the same will apply to Wii U games on the Nintendo Switch. Many fans are hoping their digital Wii U libraries will carry forward, **but for now it remains a mystery**. Some speculate Nintendo may introduce account transfers that allow associated digital titles to be re-downloaded on the Switch. However, direct backwards compatibility is unlikely due to the different architectures between the Wii U and Switch hardware.

### Virtual Console Service Coming, But Not at Launch  
Nintendo has announced plans to bring back the popular Virtual Console service to the Nintendo Switch, which will allow players to download and enjoy classic games from past systems. However, the Virtual Console **won't be available when the Switch first launches** in March 2017. Nintendo has stated Virtual Console is still in development and will come later as a post-launch feature through system updates. This leaves the door open for Wii U titles to potentially join the Virtual Console selection in the future.
### Expect Remakes Over Direct Ports of Wii U Games
Due to the change in controls between the Wii U GamePad and Switch's detachable Joy-Cons, a direct port of Wii U games is improbable. Instead, fans are more likely to see reimagined versions or "**remastered**" ports that utilize the Switch's features, such as The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Games like Mario Kart 8 and New Super Mario Bros. U would translate well with minor tweaks. Later this year, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is arriving as enhanced port for Switch, showing this approach has potential. 
### Virtual Console is Top Priority for Some Holding Onto Wii U
For dedicated Wii U owners still making use of their system, the main reason to keep it hooked up today is its Virtual Console library of older Nintendo classics. However, the looming release of the Switch is making some reconsider selling their Wii U, depending on Nintendo's plans for legacy content support. The announcement of Virtual Console coming post-launch to Switch gives hope **Wii U adopters will be able to continue enjoying their virtual libraries**. As long as key details remain scarce, some fans plan keep their Wii U just a little longer.
# Can We Expect Wii U games on the Nintendo Switch Virtual Console?
### Past Successes with Account Transfers Provide Hope
When transitioning between systems in the past, Nintendo implemented strategies to carry over digital content purchases through account linking between devices. The Wii to Wii U upgrade program set a positive precedent that gave early adopters incentives to move along with Nintendo's new hardware. If the company chooses a similar approach for the Switch, it could mean **Wii U purchases are reimbursed or redownloadable.** This outcome seems likely considering Nintendo's focus on building customer loyalty through its online accounts and relationships. 
### Remasters May Arrive First before Backwards Compatibility  
While direct virtual ports are improbable, remastered Switch versions of popular Wii U games could satisfy demand in the short term. The upcoming Deluxe edition of Mario Kart 8 shows this approach works well. Other candidates like Splatoon or Super Smash Bros. for Wii U may be re-envisioned with new multiplayer modes and gameplay tweaks that take advantage of Switch's hybrid functionality. These major first-party titles would help drive early Switch sales and give Wii U owners **games to look forward to on the new platform**.
### Fans Remain Hopeful Wii U Library Lives On
Due to the Switch's focus on versatility and portability compared to Wii U's GamePad gimmick, many feel Nintendo will want to disassociate from their previous system. However, the company also strives to maintain goodwill amongst loyal fans. The Virtual Console service could revive interest in the Wii U's catalogue down the line, after the launch window has come and gone. If account transfers transfer digital libraries **as expected based on history**, it would go a long way to please early supporters of Nintendo's past hardware. 
### Patience Required While Nintendo Finalizes Plans  
With the Switch launching in just a few months, Nintendo has understandably kept many lingering questions unanswered as they optimize their new system. Fans understand that backwards compatibility is a complex issue, so most are willing to wait and see how legacy content ultimately ties into Virtual Console and online services over the coming year. If the company can leverage their reputation for **treating customers right long-term,** uncertainty may remain but good faith in Nintendo's vision will persist amongst die-hard players. Only time will tell what solutions they provide once the Switch is live and demanding attention.
# Potential Timeline for Wii U Games on Nintendo Switch
### Virtual Console Details May Emerge at E3
The Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in June is traditionally when Nintendo unveils their big plans and games for the year ahead. With the Switch launching that same month, this year's E3 will be hugely important for setting expectations. Many expect Nintendo will provide **the first solid details about virtual console** then, such as pricing, selection of launch titles, and how they handle transferring digital libraries from past systems like the Wii U. Giving consumers a glimpse of playable classics could generate more excitement leading into the Switch launch.
### Holiday 2017 Target for Backwards Compatibility?  
Getting the Virtual Console up and running right away would benefit Nintendo, but porting an extensive library of Wii U games will take considerable development effort. It's realistic to assume **only select major first-party titles** like Mario Kart 8, Super Smash Bros. and Splatoon may receive remastered Switch versions within the system's first year. More ambitious backwards compatibility enabling all Wii U game downloads could be targeted for holiday 2017 to drive additional Switch sales during the vital shopping season. This timeline would give Nintendo a year to refine their emulation solutions.
### Games on Demand as Interim Solution?  
As an intermediate step before a robust Virtual Console is finished, Nintendo may consider a "Games on Demand" program allowing re-purchase of selected Wii U titles on Switch at a slight discount. A limited selection could launch alongside the Virtual Console to provide some backwards compatibility sooner rather than later. This approach **balances pleasing early adopters while avoiding over-committing resources** to a fledgling new platform in its launch period focused on new games.
### Forward Compatibility Also a Possibility
With the Switch designed from the start with both home and portable modes, it's not impossible that some future Wii U games under development may see **simultaneous or enhanced releases** for both systems to extend their installed bases. Nintendo has surprised before by bringing new life to past consoles this way near their sunset. Only time will tell what cross-platform strategies they may test to maximize profits across generations.
# Reactions from Dedicated Wii U Owners
### Carrying Digital Libraries to Switch Is Top Priority  
For the most dedicated Wii U fans still actively playing their system daily, the number one concern revolves around preserving their digital game collections. Many have invested hundreds, if not thousands, into the Nintendo eShop over the Wii U's lifespan **and don't want to lose access**. As long as redownloading purchases on the Switch remains uncertain, some gamers feel uncertain about transitioning to the new hardware full-time. 
### Lingering Attachments to Wii U Experiences
Besides virtual content, the unique offline or four-player experiences of games like Nintendo Land, Game & Wario or Pikmin 3 make it tough to fully let go of the Wii U. While these titles could potentially be enhanced for Switch, until then dedicated fans **enjoy revisiting the library and community they invested in.** The Wii U represents the system many players spent countless weekends and afternoons bonding with friends over.
### Appreciation for Wii U and Optimism for Switch Coexistence
Most Wii U die-hards are still eager for the promising innovations of Nintendo's new platform. But many also want to **preserve the legacy of the underrated Wii U** that gave them so many memories, rather than see it fade entirely. If Nintendo supports both systems cooperatively with overlapping virtual libraries, it could satisfy those still hanging onto their original investment while embracing the future in Switch. Dedicated fans simply want options to enjoy both.
### A Waiting Game Begins for Clarity on Ownership
With the Switch launch on the horizon yet many uncertainties unresolved, the dedicated Wii U base has entered a holding pattern. Players are keeping Wii Us close at hand while monitoring for service updates and Nintendo's evolving statements. On forums and social media, discussion focuses on **predicting the company's next move** regarding virtual console and digital ownership. The waiting game will continue until the company provides definitive answers on their plans to bring the Wii U library forward.
# Outlook - Nintendo Likely to Keep Supporting Wii U Library long-Term 
### Nintendo Values Customer Loyalty and Satisfaction 
Across decades in the console industry, Nintendo has showed a dedication to **respecting consumers' investments in their systems and games.** Whether offering system transfers, selective backwards compatibility or remasters - they consistently support past platforms to keep customers engaged. These practices help maintain goodwill that keeps fans returning generation after generation.
### Virtual Console Holds Promise to Unite Libraries
Seen as Nintendo's solution to embrace retro games digitally across their franchises,
