### Introduction
Over the years, **Discord voice chat communication app** has become extremely popular among gamers and communities worldwide. However, some users are curious about finding others' **IP address on Discord** to gather more information. This in-depth guide will explain several methods one can potentially use to discover another person's IP address when chatting through Discord, while also providing important privacy and safety considerations.

### Using Windows Command Prompt 
The Windows **command prompt netstat** command can be used to analyze all active network connections on a Windows computer. By restarting one's PC, opening Discord in a web browser, initiating a voice or text chat with the target user, and then entering specific netstat commands while keeping them engaged in conversation, it may be possible to view the IP address. However, this method provides no guarantees and depends on precise timing. Furthermore, misusing any discovered IP information could enable digital harassment, so one must proceed with caution.
### Analyzing Discord Network Traffic with Wireshark
The free and open-source **network analyzer tool Wireshark** can decrypt and inspect live network traffic in detail. By downloading the correct version for one's operating system, launching only the Discord browser app with no other tabs, and then exploring the network packets captured by Wireshark, it may allow identifying IP addresses of other users one interacts with on Discord. However, this approach requires technical proficiency and proper configuration to isolate pertinent data within Wireshark's outputs. 
### Using IP Logger Web Links
Some trusted third-party services generate custom URL links that can function as **IP loggers when others click them**, appearing innocuous to the target. For example, Grabify allows creating unique tracking links after agreeing to its terms of use. By copying the Grabify link and casually encouraging the target user to click it in a message, their true IP may become visible later by refreshing the Grabify logs. However, this relies on social engineering tricks and targets' willing participation.
### Leveraging Discord User IDs  
One direct method involves using specialized **Discord IP resolver websites**. With Discord's developer mode enabled, right-clicking a user's name allows copying their hashed user ID. Pasting this ID on the resolver site may reveal the target's current IP address. Though more direct, this approach still depends on the resolver service's accuracy and current function. Changes to Discord's API could also affect such resolvers.
### Privacy and Ethics Considerations
While the presented methods offer potential routes to find others' IP addresses, one must carefully consider privacy, safety, and ethical implications before pursuing such approaches. IPs can reveal location and connection information, so misusing them could enable digital harassment or stalking. Instead of IP discovering, a kinder approach involves building understanding and trust within online communities. Discord also warns against any activities that compromise privacy or violate its terms of use. Overall, mutual care and respect should govern all online interactions.
### Conclusion  
In summary, this guide outlined several options one may come across for potentially finding another's IP address when chatting through Discord. However, it's important to note that Discord itself does not directly expose other users' IP information. Only indirect methods exist through third-party tools, technical skills, or social engineering. Given privacy and safety risks, careful discretion is advised before applying any of these methods. Instead of fixation on IPs, cultivating positivity within online communities remains a nobler path.
