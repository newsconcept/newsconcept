### Endless Exploration and Creative Problem Solving in an Open World
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild completely revolutionized the Zelda franchise by stepping away from the traditional linear and dungeon-focused gameplay of past entries. Instead, Breath of the Wild delivers a richly detailed open world for players to freely explore at their own pace without direct guidance. From the moment I first booted up the game in 2017, I have been captivated by the opportunity to discover intriguing landmarks, creatures, and secrets around every corner. The physics-based puzzle-solving and experimentation encouraged by the game's systems have delivered countless "Aha!" moments. Whether mastering how to climb sheer surfaces, solve environmental puzzles, or overcome enemy camps, Breath of the Wild consistently surprises and delights. Its emphasis on **creative problem solving** and **open-ended exploration** have made it not only my favorite Zelda game but also my most-played Switch game to date.

### Epic JRPG Worlds with Storytelling and Complex Battle Systems
The Xenoblade Chronicles franchise from developer Monolith Soft is renowned for transporting players to sprawling fantasy worlds that could each reasonably qualify as their own continents. Xenoblade Chronicles 2 in particular delivers a beautifully realized world of towering Titan creatures that players can scale and traverse for over 150 hours of gameplay. Its memorable cast of characters and complex real-time battle system pairing player and CPU-controlled characters keep the gameplay lively throughout the epic journey. The prequel game Xenoblade Chronicles: Torna ~ The Golden Country focuses the same JRPG excellence into a tighter, but no less epic, 40 hour adventure. Both games provide ideal entry points for those seeking **immersive Japanese-style RPGs** with incredible production values for every player's dollar. 
### Strategic School Life Simulation with Tactical RPG Battles
Fire Emblem Three Houses took the series in a bold new direction by blending school life simulation and dating sim elements with the franchise's signature Tactical RPG combat. Playing as a professor at the Officers Academy, players guide a new generation of student units and develop relationships that carry over into battle. Three Houses makes meaningful choices matter more than ever, with branching story paths unfolding based on player decisions both in and out of combat. The strong production values, like fully voice acted story cutscenes, help bring the world and relationships to life. While awaiting release, early previews suggest Three Houses may deliver not only the most customizable and emotionally investing Fire Emblem experience to date, but possibly one of 2019's finest Strategy RPGs overall thanks to its clever blending of genres.
### Highly Creative Sandbox Experiences across Multiple Franchises 
Nintendo consistently delivers some of the most creative and surprising sandbox-style experiences across multiple beloved franchises. Super Mario Odyssey recaptured that magic sandbox joy of discovery the series is known for. By giving Mario his new partner Cappy, who allows the plumber to "possess" other characters and objects, no level or challenge felt quite like what came before. Similarly, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild opened its world without walls to let players approach puzzles, shrines, and enemy encounters however they wished throughexperimentation with the physics system. Both games earned widespread critical acclaim and game of the year nominations for respecting player intelligence and rewarding curiosity instead of following predefined paths. Nintendo proves again here that wholly unique and unexpected gameplay innovations can be beloved while still feeling familiar across their venerable franchises.
### The Definitive Fighting Game Package with Unprecedented Representation
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is the biggest and most definitive entry yet in the iconic Nintendo crossover fighting series. With over 70 fighters represented from Mario to Solid Snake, and 900 unique music tracks spanning decades of gaming, no other title pulls together such a celebration of gaming history. Under the hood, Sakurai and the development team have tweaked and balanced the gameplay to its most refined state yet. Coupled with a massive single player Adventure mode, online play, and robust customization options, Smash Ultimate offers dozens if not hundreds of hours of entertainment. As the first and likely only time so many iconic characters will share a roster, Smash Ultimate delivers incredible value as both the ultimate multiplayer party game and definitive celebration of Nintendo's legacy. 
### Witty Action with Unique Multiplayer Cooperation
Goichi Suda's beloved No More Heroes franchise returned for its Nintendo Switch installment Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes with its signature blend of over-the-top action and absurd surrealist humor intact. Playing through imaginative mini-games woven into an admittedly thin main story provides a welcome escape for fans of retro-styled independent games and B-movie nonsense. Where Travis really stands out is its addition of fully featured 2-player cooperative multiplayer either locally or online. Being able to tackle missions and bosses together amplifies the fun, especially since each player controls different gameplay styles. For those seeking offbeat experiences with strong co-op support, Travis Strikes Again delivers big laughs and addictive combo-oriented action.
