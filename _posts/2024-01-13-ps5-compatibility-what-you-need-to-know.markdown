## Part 1: Playing PS4 Games on PS5
### **Backwards Compatibility Brings the Entire PS4 Library to PS5** 
The PS5 offers unprecedented backwards compatibility, allowing players to enjoy nearly their entire PS4 game library on the new console. Both physical and digital PS4 games are fully supported on PS5. When inserting a PS4 disc into the PS5, the console will automatically download and run the best available version of that game, whether the original PS4 version or an optimized PS5 edition. 
Digital PS4 games in a player's PlayStation Store library can simply be redownloaded onto the PS5 without issue. Some PS4 games see modest optimizations like more stable framerates and faster loading on the PS5's powerful hardware through backwards compatibility alone. **However, the best experience comes from games that receive dedicated next-gen upgrades**.

## Part 2: Upgrades for PS4 Games on PS5
### **Performance Boosts and Feature Enhancements Elevate Last-Gen Titles**
Many popular PS4 games like God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, Days Gone, and more have all received sizable free upgrades for PS5 improving visuals, performance, and adding functionality. These "PS4 to PS5 upgrades" apply automatic HDR reconstruction, boost frame rates up to 60 or even 120 fps, and cut loading times significantly with the console's ultra-fast SSD. 
Some upgraded games go even further by adding things like 3D audio support, DualSense haptic feedback and adaptive trigger integration, and higher resolution textures taking advantage of the PS5's more powerful hardware. These updated versions effectively give new life to classic PS4 titles. While Sony initially said these upgrades would cost money, they've since made them free to ensure players get the best experience possible.
## Part 3: PS5-Specific Versions and Exclusive Features  
### **Tailored Titles Made for PS5 Shine on the New Platform**
Beyond backwards compatible PS4 games, many titles are releasing dedicated native PS5 versions built from the ground up to take full advantage of Sony's latest console. These PS5 editions cannot be played on PS4 and allow developers to fully leverage new features like the ultra-fast SSD for almost instant level loading. 
Games with **PS5-only versions** are able to implement 3D audio, haptic feedback, and adaptive triggers in innovative new ways. Visuals also see massive leaps with support for 4K/60fps or higher resolutions alongside real-time ray tracing for more realistic lighting. Load times are practically non-existent. If looking to experience the true next-gen sensation, seeking out dedicated PS5 editions is key.
## Part 4: Playing Disc and Digital Games 
### **Physical Media and Downloads Both Have Merit on PS5**
While the digital-only PS5 skips disc drives, the standard PS5 still supports both physical media and downloaded games. Discs provide an affordable used game market and don't take up internal storage. Inserting a supported PS4 or PS5 disc into the PS5 console allows it to run that same game, whether a player owns it digitally or physically. 
Downloaded digital games link to a user's account, don't require swapping discs, and access is retained if the disc drive breaks. Both physical discs and digital downloads have pros and cons. The used game market via discs provides cheaper access to a huge library, while going all-digital connects games permanently to an account.
## Part 5: Future of PS4 vs PS5 Development
### **New Hardware-Only Releases Will Dominate as Install Base Grows** 
As the number of PS5 consoles in homes increases over the coming years, major third-party games and big-budget Sony exclusives will shift solely to native PS5 development. While PS4 support isn't ending immediately, dedicating staff time to develop and optimize for aging hardware will become less common. Backwards compatible PS4 games will still be playable as the ecosystem evolves.
More games will drop last-gen console versions entirely or release those versions much later to instead focus on taking full advantage of the PS5's powerful SSD, 3D audio, haptics, and visual capabilities up front. This will maximize the generational leap. However, many AA and indie titles may continue multi-platform releases for a longer tail period to reach wider audiences until the installed base is larger.
## Part 6: Reasons to Seek PS5-Optimized Games
### **Utilizing Next-Gen Hardware to Its Fullest Potential**
While backwards compatibility gives continued life to one's PS4 library, those looking to truly experience everything the PS5 has to offer will want to seek out games made solely for the new system. Not only will these PS5-exclusive titles see massive graphical leaps with usage of real-time ray tracing and 4K/120fps capabilities, they'll make use of defining PS5 features like near-instant loading. 
Haptics, adaptive triggers, and 3D audio will also be implemented to new heights when developers have the console's architecture in mind from the start. This helps future-proof one's investment by experiencing what can only be done now rather than through emulating older tech. For those upgrading consoles, doesn't it make sense to play the newest games designed from the ground up for that hardware? 
## Part 7: The Author's Library and Experience So Far
### **Combining PS4 Carryovers with Bespoke PS5 Games**
As a longtime PlayStation owner upgrading to the PS5, I've amassed a diverse game library spanning both generations. Approximately half of my current collection spreads across both PS4 and PS5 versions of the same titles like Spider-Man, Demon's Souls, and Sackboy to experience free next-gen upgrades. 
The other half consists solely of bespoke PS5 games that showcase the new platform like Returnal, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, Astro's Playroom, and Deathloop. Juggling upgraded past favorites with new exclusives has been a blast. Going forward, I aim to primarily purchase games with PS5 editions in mind to take full advantage of the capabilities Sony's console has to offer into this generation.
# Conclusion
While backwards compatibility breathes new life into PlayStation owners' PS4 libraries, those seeking to maximize their investment in the PS5 will want to focus on bespoke games built from the ground up for Sony's new hardware. Not only do these PS5 editions ensure top performance with framerates up to 120fps, lightning fast loading, and engage haptics/triggers, but they showcase innovations only possible now like 3D audio and potentially ray tracing down the line. As more people upgrade consoles, development attention will continue shifting to PS5 exclusives over the long run. New hardware warrants playing new games optimized for its full feature set.
