### Introduction 
When upgrading to the latest game consoles, many gamers ponder whether trading in old hardware and games is a wise path to lowering costs. This can be a feasible strategy if trade-in valuations are reasonable relative to the new console's price tag. Let's analyze the potential trade-in values of a PS3, PS2, Xbox One S and accessories against the cost of a new PlayStation 5 to see if this route makes **financial sense for the budget-minded gamer**.

### The PlayStation 3: A Beloved But Aging Platform 
The PS3 was a revolutionary console that redefined what was possible in home entertainment with its **blu-ray support and digital distribution capabilities**. However, being over a decade old means developers have long since moved on. Any PS3 on the market today would fetch between $100-$200 depending on the specific model and condition. The **backwards compatible slim PS3 models that can play PS1/PS2 games in addition** would garner higher valuations from nostalgic collectors. 
While the library of critically acclaimed PS3 exclusives gives it enduring appeal, the platform's online services and software support continue winding down. Unless a true **aficionado of that console generation** is seeking to relive the glory days, the average buyer isn't as interested. Realistically, a basic working PS3 wouldn't offset the retail price of a new PS5 in a meaningful way through a trade.
### The PlayStation 2: An Icon At The End Of Its Run
Sony's PS2 cemented itself as one of the best-selling consoles of all time thanks to its incredible catalog and broad third-party backing over countless hardware revisions. However, being two generations behind means even a fully-functional unit would struggle to fetch over $20 in a trade today. Anything described as only working **"for parts"** could essentially be considered worthless aside from niche enthusiasts seeking replacement components. 
With no current-gen games and an antiquated technical spec, the userbase inclined to relive the PS2 era has long since moved on. Unless an exceptionally **rare or collectible model in pristine condition**, this vintage system holds negligible value in the used market. It simply can't offset the PS5's MSRP when retailers won't pay more than spare change for one.
### The Xbox One S: Potential But Dependent On Condition
Microsoft's mid-generation "slim" revision of the original Xbox One, known as the Xbox One S, represented a slight **technical upgrade and smaller form factor over its predecessor**. Still within the current console cycle though nearing end-of-life, a One S **in full working order with accessories and games could command $200-300**, providing some contribution towards a new purchase. 
However, OP indicated their One S was **"better for parts"** implying some non-functional element. In a broken state, a trade-in outlet wouldn't pay a cent beyond very basic recycling value. Unless lucky to find someone seeking specific components, a non-working One S holds negligible real world value in the used market.
### Comparing The Hardware Generations
While nearly a decade separates the aging PS3 from the still-relevant Xbox One S, both represent very different stages in console evolution. The PS3 pushed technological boundaries but is long outdated by today's standards. In contrast, the One S delivered the current generation experience in a more **compact and energy efficient form**. 
Moreover, with the PS4/Xbox One generation still receiving new releases as supply shortages impact next-gen adoption, the One S maintains some **residual software support potential**. Nevertheless, either platform pales in comparison to the raw horsepower and modern features offered by the new PS5. Come trade-in time, that generational gap becomes readily apparent in valuation differentials.
### Library Legacies Impact Desirability 
Both the PS3 and Xbox One left behind acclaimed franchises that bolster each system's relevance in the pre-owned market to some degree. The PS3 attained culturally significant status thanks to genre-defining story-driven exclusives unavailable elsewhere. Meanwhile, the sheer volume of multiplatform third-party titles released across the One family extends that console's appeal.
Yet backwards compatibility and new installment releases diminish over time. Unless motivated by serious nostalgia, few buyers remain engaged enough with legacy libraries to offset hardware price drops caused by generational drift. This gradual library aging process erodes trade values more acutely than technical shortcomings alone. 
### Weighing The Options Against New Hardware Costs
Given trade-ins unlikely reach anywhere near the PS5's MSRP, selling the old consoles individually through online marketplaces presents a better option - if functional. A One S with positive reviews might yield $150-250, while $50-100 could be attainable for a working PS3. Broken hardware carries no real value unfortunately. 
Rather than expect pristine payouts from retailers invariably low-balling old generation tech, gamers serious about next-gen may find fundraising through **alternative side gigs or extra savings allotments** provides a surer means to new hardware acquisition. Especially when console conditions diminish trade values precipitously.
### Conclusion
While nostalgia ensures past platforms like the renowned PS2 and feature-packed PS3 retain informal value for devoted fans, the used game console market judges hardware primarily on recency and functionality. Outdated technologies and broken items carry little monetary worth realistically. Fortunately, new consoles become increasingly attainable through patience and planning outside reliance on trade-ins alone. With dedication and **creative budgeting strategies**, transitioning between generations remains achievable for dedicated gamers.
