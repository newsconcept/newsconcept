## Part 1: The Popular Popcorn Prank
### **Popcorn popping phone prank**
In 2008, a viral video claimed to show popcorn popping when placed between two activated cell phones. However, this was later revealed to be a marketing stunt by a Bluetooth headset maker who used digital editing to fake the effect. Copycat hoaxes also emerged, with one mounting a microwave magnetron underneath the table creating a dangerous situation.

### **Why phones lack the power to pop popcorn**  
Mobile phones operate at frequencies between 400-1800 MHz and output less than 1 watt of power. This is drastically less than a microwave oven's 2450 MHz frequency and 500-1000 watts of power. The low energy and limited absorption abilities of phones means they can't generate enough localized heat within a reasonable timeframe to pop popcorn or cook other foods.
## Part 2: The Egregious Egg-Cooking Hoax
### **Tall tale of boiled eggs between phones**
In 2006, a bogus article in a Russian tabloid claimed photos showed boiling an egg in over an hour by placing it between two activated phones. This false story was spread worldwide through emails with alarms about phone radiation dangers. 
### **Failed replication experiments** 
When the claim went viral, various experiments were conducted to reproduce the results, such as one documented by a New York Times writer. However, all experiments ended with uncooked eggs, even after extended periods between activated phones. The phones simply lacked the capability to generate cooking temperatures.
## Part 3: More Thorough Testing Debunks the Myth 
### **Increased phones and accessories still don't cook eggs**
A British science program tried using 100 stacked phones under an egg but still couldn't cook it. Another website documented using multiple phones, laptops, and computer monitors on an egg for 10 minutes, finding it remained cold throughout.
### **Physics confirms phones' thermal limitations**  
The fundamental physics demonstrates mobile phones maximum specified power output and interaction with matter make it impossible to heat even a small object like an egg up to cooking temperatures. Their energy levels and absorption abilities are far too restricted for such applications.
## Part 4: Industry Explanations Validate Testing Results
### **Official power specifications disprove claims**
A telecommunications industry body cited mobile phone maximum power specifications to calculate the temperature increase of a 50g egg would only reach 13Â°C in an hour between two phones activated at full power. In reality, insulation and inefficiencies would mean an even lower temperature increase.
### **Phones designed for communication, not cooking**  
Mobile phones are engineered and regulated for safe wireless communication, not cooking or heating applications. Their relatively low output makes them physically unable to generate enough localized heat transfer needed for cooking no matter how many are activated together.
## Part 5: Hoaxes Persist Despite Repeated Debunking  
### **Fact-checking sites regularly refute returning claims**
Whenever the egg and popcorn cooking hoaxes resurface online, fact-checking websites like Snopes promptly republish evidence conclusively disproving the impossible claims through testing and technical documentation.
### **Why do myths persist despite evidence?**
Even after over a decade of clear evidence against the claims, some still want to believe the myths about new technologies. Their popularity shows how eager humans are to spread questionable health concerns, despite credible technical analysis disproving supposed "dangers".
## Part 6: Preferring Traditional Methods  
### **Opting for tried-and-true cooking techniques**  
Rather than participate in misleading internet hoaxes, the author prefers using time-tested cooking methods like heating oil in a saucepan on the stovetop to safely and reliably pop fresh popcorn. 
### **Keeping food prep straightforward and hazard-free**  
Simple preparation without technological gimmicks or dubious claims ensures food is cooked properly without risks to health or safety. There's no need to make cooking more complex than it needs to be.
