### Introduction
PlayStation Plus is a paid subscription service for the PlayStation platforms that unlocks online multiplayer and provides members with exclusive discounts, cloud storage, and a curated library of games every month. However, one of the most commonly asked questions is whether PS Plus is required to play the popular sandbox game Minecraft online with friends. This guide will definitively answer that question and provide additional context around Sony's paid multiplayer mandates.

### Minecraft Box Clearly States Online Multiplayer Requires a Subscription 
If you look at the back of the physical Minecraft box for PlayStation 4, it explicitly calls out that an **"active PlayStation Plus membership is required for online multiplayer"**. While Minecraft is a game focused on creativity and cooperative building, joining friends online to build and explore together is a big part of the Minecraft experience. Sony has been clear that this type of online multiplayer gameplay requires a paid subscription through PS Plus. 
### Local Split-Screen Coop Does Not Require PS Plus
An important exception is that while Minecraft's online multiplayer is behind the PS Plus paywall, you can still enjoy local split-screen co-op gameplay without a subscription. Up to four controllers can connect to a single PlayStation 4 to allow local friends and family to play together in the same virtual world. This split-screen coop mode provides a workaround for casual shared Minecraft sessions without requiring all players to purchase PS Plus.
### PlayStation Plus Became Mandatory for PS4 Online Play
When Sony launched the PlayStation 4 generation in 2013, they made the controversial decision to require all online multiplayer on the console to be behind the PlayStation Plus paywall. This changed the model from previous PlayStation platforms where online was free for the basic functions. PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida cited the growing costs of maintaining PlayStation Network servers and developing new online features as part of their rationale for the PS Plus mandate. 
### Maintaining Online Services Has Considerable Ongoing Costs  
Running robust online services at the scale of PlayStation Network comes with massive costs for servers, bandwidth, software development, security, and emergency support staff that must be addressed year-round. While requiring a subscription limits accessibility, it provides Sony with sustainable funding to continually invest in upgrading their online infrastructure and developing new connectivity options like cross-play. Without alternative revenue streams, the quality and functionality of PlayStation's services could deteriorate over time.
### Inclusion of Free Games Helps Offset Subscription Costs
As a benefit of the subscription, PS Plus members receive access to a curated library of games that can be downloaded and played at no extra cost as long as the membership remains active. Over the years, this has included many acclaimed titles across various genres. While the subscription itself can be viewed primarily as a paid multiplayer pass, the inclusion of these free games undoubtedly provides additional value that helps offset the regular membership costs for many users.
### Price Increase but PlayStation Plus Remains Competitive  
In 2020, the annual PlayStation Plus subscription cost was increased by $10 USD to $59.99 annually in North America. This pricing brings it more in line with Microsoft's Xbox Live Gold annual membership of $59.99 USD. While any price hike is understandably undesirable to consumers, PlayStation Plus continues to remain competitively priced compared to Xbox Live for access to similar online gaming capabilities and included membership perks. 
### Conclusion
In summary, PlayStation Plus is mandatory for most online gaming functionality on PlayStation 4, including Minecraft's suite of multiplayer modes. However, local co-op in split-screen does not require a subscription. While the paid online model is a change from previous PlayStation generations, maintaining robust online services at PlayStation Network's scale comes with colossal costs that need ongoing funding sources. PS Plus not only unlocks multiplayer, but also provides notable other benefits like free monthly games that help justify the subscription price in the eyes of many members. So for online Minecraft and the majority of PS4 games, PlayStation Plus remains a necessity.
