## Part 1: The Development of Fallout New Vegas
### **Obsidian struggled with deadlines and content optimizations**  
Obsidian Entertainment was tasked with developing Fallout New Vegas as the follow up title to Bethesda Game Studio's Fallout 3. However, Obsidian had a challenging development due to being handed an 18-month deadline to work with Bethesda's Gamebryo engine. Getting all planned content and functionality working smoothly on consoles proved difficult within the timeframe. Deadlines were missed which created issues between the studios. Obsidian also had to crunch heavily towards the end to meet their launch window. While the game was critically acclaimed, the rushed development left Obsidian feeling soured on the experience.

## Part 2: Vow to Never Work on Another Studio's IP Again
### **Obsidian swore off working on franchises they didn't fully own**
Due to struggles meeting Bethesda's strict schedule and technical optimization requirements, Obsidian vowed after New Vegas that they did not want to find themselves in that position again of working within the constraints of another company's intellectual property. They wanted full control over timelines, resources and long term planning for any future roleplaying games they developed. This attitude from Obsidian leadership reinforced the idea they may never directly collaborate with Bethesda again on the Fallout franchise. 
## Part 3: Changes at Obsidian Since New Vegas
### ** departures left Obsidian without many of the key "New Vegas" developers**  
In the decade since the release of Fallout New Vegas, there has been significant turnover at Obsidian Entertainment. Many veterans who worked on the beloved post-apocalyptic Western RPG have moved on to other studios. This includes Feargus Urquhart and Chris Avellone founding their own company InXile Entertainment in 2002. Other "New Vegas" alumni have gone to work at Private Division, Arkane Studios, inXile and more - leaving Obsidian without the core team that understood the intricate lore and systems integral to Fallout.
## Part 4: inXile Entertainment's Independence  
### **After gaining rights to franchise that inspired Fallout, inXile focused on their own gaming worlds**
In 2002 inXile Entertainment was founded by Feargus Urquhart and Brian Fargo after their time at Black Isle Studios. They reclaimed the rights to the original post-apocalyptic role-playing game Wasteland which served as a major inspiration for the Fallout franchise. This allowed inXile to finally return to that franchise with games like Wasteland 2 and 3. With their own successful sequels under their belt and no obligation to others, inXile has remained dedicated to building out their own independent gaming universes rather than relying on licensing other companies' brands.
## Part 5: Microsoft's Acquisitions Change the Landscape
### **Bethesda, Obsidian and inXile are now all under same corporate ownership after Microsoft purchases**  
In September 2018, Microsoft acquired inXile Entertainment and once again united former "New Vegas" developers under one publisher. Then in March 2020, Microsoft went on to purchase Bethesda Softworks' parent company ZeniMax Media. This included Bethesda Game Studios, the developers of Fallout 3 and Fallout 4. Finally in June 2021, Obsidian Entertainment was acquired by Microsoft as well. While the studios are now all owned by the same corporation, Microsoft has pledged to let them operate independently and maintain focus on their own beloved IPs rather than mandating collaborations.
## Part 6: Unlikelihood of Forced Collaboration Moving Forward  
### **Restarting New Vegas or pushing a full remake could upset studios and fans**
With divergent priorities and talent shifts since 2010, forcibly reviving the Fallout New Vegas partnership at this point would not be in the best interests of Obsidian, Bethesda or the fanbase. A direct sequel risks upsetting remaining "New Vegas" creators no longer at Obsidian. Meanwhile, Bethesda does not typically fund full remakes led by outside studios as that takes focus from new titles. Additionally, redoing the game without the key original developers could draw criticism for lack of authenticity or vision. Both studios are now best served creating new adventures in their respective franchises.
## Part 7: Bethesda's Approach to Remasters and Ports  
### **Creation Club and Special Editions helped bring past games to new platforms as testbeds for future projects** 
Over the past console generations, Bethesda has taken a hands-on approach to remasters - handling them internally rather than farming them out. Recent projects like Skyrim Special Edition and Fallout 4: Game of the Year Edition served not just to bring beloved RPGs to new consoles/PCs, but also helped Bethseda's internal teams become accustomed to new development environments and pipelines in preparation for sequels. Similarly, Creation Club mods for Skyrim and Fallout 4 served as a testing ground for potential monetization models while keeping those communities engaged until new Elder Scrolls/Fallout releases.
## Part 8: Potential for Obsidian Involvement in the Future?  
### **Rumors suggest remasters of earlier Fallout and Elder Scrolls titles could use support teams, but nothing is confirmed** 
While extremely unlikely Obsidian would spearhead a new Fallout project for Bethesda, there has been speculation their involvement could make sense for potential remasters or re-releases of past entries in the franchises now owned by Microsoft. Games like Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion would benefit from enhanced visuals and functionality on modern consoles/PCs. Leveraging Obsidian or other internal Microsoft studios' talents could help bring those classic role-playing games to new audiences in polished forms. However, Bethesda has not officially announced any plans regarding older game remasters at this time. Fans can only hope future collaborations may become possible under the Xbox umbrella.
