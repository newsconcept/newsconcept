### **The Morning Frustration of Constant Website Errors and Instant Sellouts**
As the launch day of the highly anticipated Sony PlayStation 5 grew nearer, the excitement and anticipation within me steadily rose. However, getting my hands on the new console proved much more difficult than I had expected or hoped. The morning of November 12th saw me battle website errors and instant sellouts during the scheduled restocks at major retailers like Walmart. Time and again over the first few hours, I desperately tried to add a PS5 console to my cart only to be met with endless loading screens and error messages. On the rare occasions I managed to navigate through the site glitches, upon reaching checkout the much wanted system would already be marked as out of stock. The frustration of coming so close, just to have my hopes dashed by scalpers and faulty websites, grew with each failed attempt.

### **Noon Brought No Better Luck Despite Hopes for Stable Sites** 
By midday, after countless rounds of disappointment, my optimism was waning. Still, reports circulated of more stock coming at 3pm and stability improvements to Walmart's site. I remained determined in my quest, though downhearted from the morning's struggles. Right at 3pm I refreshed eagerly, only to find the same cycle repeating - errors abound, constant reloading, and instant sellouts before checkout could be finalized. It seemed the "stability" promised brought no real change, as Walmart's infrastructure buckled under the traffic once more. With each failed try, a small piece of myLaunch Day spirit died. 
### **A Glimmer of Hope in the Late Afternoon and Evening Restocks**
Through online discussion boards, I learned more stock was planned for 6pm and 9pm drops at various major retailers. This news provided a small ray of hope in what had so far been a disheartening day. I resolved to keep diligently refreshing and battling websites for as long as restocks continued. Even as frustration mounted with each error or notice of a console slipping from my cart, I refused to give up the fight so easily. Coming this far, I was not ready to accept defeat without exhausting every opportunity. So through the late afternoon and evening hours I persisted, staring intently at loading screens and mashing refresh buttons feverishly. 
### **A Shocking Success Against All Odds** 
Against all expectations after countless failures, incredible fortune finally shone brightly. At approximately 8:45pm, against all reasoned logic, I somehow managed to navigate Walmart's chaotic site swiftly. Through a series of miraculous clicks, a console was added to my cart and checkout swiftly completed before any issues could arise. In a state of stunned disbelief, I saw the confirmation - a PlayStation 5 was being processed for delivery on launch day, as promised. After a journey filled with turmoil, stress, and disappointment, an unlikely victory was achieved when hope seemed lost. The celebrations and relief I felt in that moment of shocking success cannot be overstated.  
### **Reflections on a Rocky Road to the Next Generation of Gaming**
While the conclusion of my launch day quest was happier than expected given the trials faced along the way, frustration and stress dominated much of the experience. Websites buckled under heavy traffic, scalpers swept up units to resell at inflated prices, and the desperation of gamers to be among the first to experience the new hardware was palpable. In retrospect, the numerous issues and disappointment should have been foreseeable give demand far outpaced supply. Still, Sony and retailers could have done much more to ensure a smoother process for legitimate customers. After the emotional rollercoaster of high anticipation, low hopes, and surprising triumph against all odds, I'm left with mixed feelings. Relief at achieving my goal is tempered by sympathy for those still struggling, and wariness of future launches. Nonetheless, I remain excited to explore what PlayStation 5 has to offer for the future of gaming. While the road was long and winding, the destination will be well worth it.
