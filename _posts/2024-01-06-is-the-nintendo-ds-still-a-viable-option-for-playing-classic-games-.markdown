### Part 1: Reflecting on the Legacy of the Nintendo DS
The Nintendo DS sold over 154 million units worldwide during its lifespan, making it the best-selling handheld game system of all time. Its massive success was driven by appealing games across many popular franchises like **Mario**, **Pokémon**, The Legend of Zelda, and Professor Layton. Third party developers also contributed numerous titles that took advantage of the DS's unique features. 
While production of new Nintendo DS hardware ended in 2014 with the launch of the 3DS, the platform's legacy lives on through its expansive game library. Fans looking to experience platformers, RPGs, puzzle games, and more from the 2000s still have a wealth of acclaimed DS titles to choose from. Games like New Super Mario Bros., Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass established themselves as classics that hold up remarkably well today. 
### Part 2: Finding Nintendo DS Systems and Games in 2022
As the Nintendo DS reached the end of its lifespan nearly a decade ago, obtaining brand new systems and games is no longer possible. However, there are still several viable options for tracking down DS hardware and software in 2022. Online marketplaces like **eBay** regularly see previously owned DS systems and cartridges listed for sale. Local used game stores may also have some DS games and consoles in stock. 
The secondary market prices for DS items have remained fair given the system's popularity. Basic original DS and DS Lite models can usually be found for under $50. Top DS titles from bigger franchises generally sell between $10-25 depending on condition. More obscure or rare DS games have higher prices, but the overall collection is still affordable to rebuild compared to other retro systems. With patience and searching, dedicated fans can absolutely outfit themselves with a full DS setup at reasonable cost today.
### Part 3: Continued Compatibility with the Nintendo 3DS  
While the Nintendo 3DS is primarily seen as the successor to the DS line, it also maintains full backwards compatibility with the immense DS software library. Every DS game released works flawlessly when inserted into the 3DS's game card slot. This opens up another accessible option for playing DS classics beyond hunting down old hardware.
All Nintendo 3DS models, from the original 3DS to the recently discontinued New Nintendo 2DS XL, can play any DS title without issue. Coupled with the 3DS's bigger screens and improvements like a second analog circle pad on newer models, DS games are given a modernized experience. Nintendo also continued to make DS games available for purchase through the 3DS eShop up until its closure in 2023. Even digitally, fans could re-download DS games they originally bought.
### Part 4: Enduring Appeal of the Nintendo DS Library 
With such a gargantuan library of over 2,500 releases across its lifetime, the Nintendo DS offered players an overwhelming selection of great games. Its library remained strong right up until the very end too, with acclaimed titles like The World Ends With You and Elite Beat Agents releasing late in the platform's cycle. 
The broad success of IP-driven adventures like New **Super Mario Bros.**, **Pokémon** Diamond/Pearl, and the **Zelda** remakes proved the handheld was capable of handling console-quality experiences. Meanwhile, breakout hits in other genres like the Professor Layton puzzle games, Rhythm Heaven, and the **Animal Crossing** and Final Fantasy re-releases kept the selection diverse and surprising.
Whether one is looking to replay old favorites or discover hidden gems, the sheer breadth of the DS library ensures there is something to satisfy every type of player. Beloved series that were ideally suited to the dual-screen format like Scribblenauts and Ace Attorney still hold up remarkably well. Even after 15+ years, the best DS games maintain their magic.
### Part 5: Nostalgia and Discovery Drive Continued Interest
For longtime Nintendo fans that grew up with the DS, revisiting its library can be a major source of nostalgia. Playing through classic puzzle, RPG, or platforming adventures they enjoyed in their youth allows one to recapture the magic of gaming portably in the 2000s and early 2010s. 
Meanwhile, younger players just being introduced to the DS library have a tremendous back catalogue of acclaimed yet overlooked classics to uncover. Whether it's tracking down cult RPGs like The World Ends With You or exploring the early entries in now-household gaming franchises, there is so much for new fans of retro and handheld gaming to appreciate.
Between the hardcore nostalgia seekers and those still discovering the DS for the first time, interest in its library shows no signs of slowing down. Having such a huge volume of beloved Nintendo-published and third party developed games so conveniently accessible keeps drawing players back, helping ensure this already legendary handheld remains a popular option for the foreseeable future.
### Part 6: The Nintendo DS is Still a Killer Option for Retro Portable Gaming 
Over fifteen years since its original launch, the Nintendo DS maintains a surprisingly vibrant legacy thanks to its enormous games library and continued backwards compatibility. While no longer the primary focus of new releases, being able to pick up classic DS titles through inexpensive used systems or on the 3DS gives the platform incredible long-term sustainability. 
Gamers longing to relive the magic of dual-screen DS experiences or wanting an affordable entry point into retro handheld collecting would be hard-pressed to find a better system. Its catalogue overflows with memorable titles that still enthrall, from fan favorites to hidden surprises. The ability to appreciate pixelated DS greatness remains simply through playing on original hardware or backwards compatible 3DS consoles.
Overall, the Nintendo DS has cemented itself as one of gaming's all-time essential handhelds. Even with subsequent systems like the 3DS and Switch, the platform's legacy lives on through its millions of dedicated fans around the world continuing to play and share their love of DS games new and old. For accessible retro portable fun that can be easily found, the Nintendo DS is undoubtedly still a killer option.
