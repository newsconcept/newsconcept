### Getting Your Games Ready to Play 
One of the main draws of upgrading to the new Xbox Series X/S is continuing your existing game library. Microsoft has focused on extensive **backward compatibility** to ensure most Xbox One, Xbox 360 and even original Xbox titles can be played on the new hardware with **optimized** versions available for download. Before setting up your new console, it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with the **list of backward compatible games** found on xbox.com to know what titles will carry over seamlessly. While many games can simply be inserted from disc to download the new version, some required discs to still function as the **game license**.

### Understanding Physical and Digital Game Licenses
One important distinction is whether games in your existing library were purchased physically on disc or digitally through the online stores. Games bought on disc will continue requiring the original disc as the **license key** to allow launching and playing each title, even though they are installed on the internal storage. However, digitally purchased games are tied directly to your Xbox Live account, so as long as you sign in, the entire **digital game library** can be accessed on the new system without discs. It's worth noting the Series S does not have an optical disc drive, so any physical games would need to be installed from an external drive.
### Choosing the Right External Storage  
While the advanced solid-state drives inside the Series X and S provide blazing fast load times, the standard storage capacities may fill up quickly with large next-gen **install sizes**. Luckily both systems support expanding storage through external hard drives. However, it's important to understand the different performance profiles of external drive options before choosing which one matches your needs. Only the fastest external **SSDs** can provide load times nearing those from the internal drives for the biggest **storage capacity boost**. More affordable external hard disk drives (HDDs) will still work fine but result in noticeably slower load and transfer speeds compared to internal storage. Gamers should carefully assess their **game library size** and play habits to determine if expanded external storage is really necessary or simply a luxury. 
### Transferring Games Over a Local Network
For users with more than one Xbox console in the same home, one simple transfer method is leveraging the local network connection between systems. Both consoles need to be powered on and connected to the same router. First, enabling the "Network Transfer" setting lets the source Xbox share its storage contents. Then on the destination Series X/S, going into "Backup and Transfer" shows the local network devices. Selecting the original console allows choosing specific **installed games** to copy over the network connection, ensuring those titles are readily available on the new hardware without redownloading huge files.
### Setting Up a Network Game Transfer
To get started with a network transfer, navigate to "Settings" then "General" on the source Xbox One and enable the "Allow network transfers" toggle. This permits the system storage to be visible to other devices on the local network. Next, power on the new Xbox Series X/S and open the "Backup and Transfer" page under the "Profile and System" section of the settings menu. Here, select the option to transfer from another Xbox One over the local network. The screen will then display any recognized source devices, letting you pick the original console. Finally, a list of all **installed titles** appears for transferring individual games or entire groups with a single selection.
### Using an External Hard Drive for Flexibility  
Network transfers work well for users with multiple consoles nearby, but what about those who want to move their gaming setup entirely? Thankfully external hard drives provide a convenient way to transport an entire Xbox **games library** between locations without an internet connection. Simply plug any USB external hard drive formatted for Xbox storage into the original console, select the desired titles under "Backups" then copy them over. From that point, bringing the portable drive to the new Series X/S lets those same **game installs** be directly accessed once more without tedious reinstalling or downloading.
### Understanding External Drive Performance 
While external hard drives expand storage capacity, it's important to manage expectations on loading efficiency. Any externally attached drive, whether HDD or SSD, will result in longer loading screens than the internal storage. This is because the USB interface has lower bandwidth than the proprietary high-speed protocols inside the consoles. Even the fastest external SSDs may only deliver load times within 10-20% of internal performance. For most gamers, this difference will be negligible compared to the flexibility of having entire **game library archives**. However, users focused purely on maximizing load speed should keep game installations on internal storage.
### Choosing the Appropriate Transfer Method
In summary, network transfers offer a hassle-free solution if both the original and new Xbox systems are located near each other with a local WiFi connection available. External hard drives are best suited when transporting a full setup between multiple locations without relying on internet access. When selecting an external drive, Optimal choices evaluate needs for maximum available **storage space** or prioritizing **transfer speeds**. No matter which transfer path is taken, with games moved over, players can look forward to the heightened experiences brought by powerful processing on the Xbox Series X/S hardware.
### Enjoying Next-Gen Gaming on Your New Console  
With patience and planning, all those beloved existing Xbox games can join your new system's library with ease. Microsoft's commitment to backwards compatibility means hundreds of titles, including entire generations of games, can carry forward without limitation. Fully transferring the collection over sets the stage to appreciate the enhancements brought by cutting-edge capabilities like enhanced resolutions/frame rates, lightning quick load times, and future compatibility through hardware advancements. After putting in the work re-acquiring your library, sit back and start exploring the next-gen gaming capabilities that make the Xbox Series X/S perfect to evolve your favorite franchises and experiences into a new generation.
