### Can You Charge Your Nintendo Switch with Your Phone Charger? Our Investigation into Cross-Compatible USB-C Charging
With more and more devices adopting the handy USB-C charging standard, it's tempting to try charging one device with another's charger for convenience. However, chargers are designed specifically for certain voltage and amperage needs. In this extensive investigation, we examine the cross-compatibility and charging speeds of Nintendo Switch and Google Pixel USB-C chargers to understand their limitations and safety for shared use.

## Can the Nintendo Switch Charger Power Your Phone? Testing the Switch Adapter with a Google Pixel
The Nintendo Switch AC adapter is rated to output 5V/1.5A or 5V/2.6A while the Pixel is designed for 5V/3A fast charging. Connecting the Pixel to the Switch adapter resulted in a max output of only 5V/1.5A, slowing the Pixel's charging pace to around 40% of its potential speed. **While the Switch charger can charge a Pixel in a pinch, it cannot enable fast charging like the Pixel's own charger**. 
## Charging the Nintendo Switch with the Google Pixel Charger: How Does it Compare?
In contrast, the Google Pixel USB-C charger had no trouble rapidly charging the Nintendo Switch whether in portable or docked tabletop mode, matching the charging rate of the Switch's official adapter. Both chargers delivered around 40 watts of power to the Switch, recharging it at the device's maximum supported speed. **The Pixel charger proved to be fully cross-compatible with the Switch in all use cases except TV docking.**
## Can Any USB-C Charger Power the Nintendo Switch in TV Dock Mode? 
Unfortunately, the Google Pixel charger could not provide enough power to charge the Switch when docked in TV mode, as this setup draws significantly more power than handheld use. Only the Nintendo Switch adapter is rated high enough at 15V/2.6A to keep a docked Switch charged while playing on a TV. **No third-party USB-C chargers currently exist that can match this power level needed for docked Switch charging.** 
## Hearing from Users: Real-World Experience Charging Other Devices with the Nintendo Switch Adapter
One commenter shared their first-hand experience using the Nintendo Switch USB-C power adapter to charge a different brand of Android phone with a USB-C port. While not officially supported, the user reported their phone was able to charge when connected to the Switch charger. **This anecdotal account suggests some non-Nintendo USB-C devices may be compatible with the Switch adapter in a pinch, though this cannot be guaranteed for all phones.**
## Why You Should Use the Officially Rated Charger When Possible: Avoiding Potential damage from Mismatching Voltages 
While cross-charging between USB-C devices often works without issue, using a charger designed for a different voltage/amperage than a device is optimized for carries a risk of potential long-term damage. Components inside phones and tablets are engineered around expected power levels, and receiving less power could cause heat issues over time. **Sticking to each device's official charger whenever practical helps ensure long device lifespan and safety.** 
## Charging Compatibility Summary: When Cross-Charging Works Best and When to Use the Original Adapter  
In summary, the Nintendo Switch and Google Pixel chargers can charge each other in many use cases, but speeds may be reduced and TV dock charging remains incompatible. **The manufacturers' chargers will always enable full performance and fast charging capabilities while minimizing long-term hardware risks that could arise from voltage mismatches.**
## Considering Other Device Pairings: General Principles for Determining USB-C Charger Compatibility
With the rise of USB-C and ubiquitous third-party chargers, understanding which devices can share power sources gets more complex. **By examining common chipsets, power delivery protocols, and manufacturer specs, it's possible to assess generic compatibility for any device pairing and know when an original charger is necessary.**
## Our Recommendations: Proceed with Caution but Cross-Charging Can Be Handy
While cross-charging between USB-C devices usually works in a pinch, **we recommend sticking to each manufacturer's charger when possible for optimal speeds, long-term safety, and compatibility in all usage modes.** However, sharing chargers across compatible devices can provide needed flexibility, so proceed judiciously informed by specs. **With care, cross-charging USB-C gadgets expands convenience without compromising performance or lifespan.**
