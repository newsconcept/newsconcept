### The Direct Download Method Does Not Work
While it may seem tempting to directly download Steam games without actually installing the Steam client, this approach will not allow you to play those games. **Steam digital rights management system** requires that all games associated with a Steam account be downloaded and launched through the Steam platform. 
Steam uses its own proprietary **digital distribution platform** to handle game installations, updates, and digital license verification. Without the Steam client handling these processes, the games will be unable to properly recognize your account's ownership and allow you to play. At best, directly downloading game files may allow you to view some game assets or data externally, but will prevent actual game launch and play.

### Steam Installation is Required for Game Downloads and Playback
In order to download Steam games and play them on your PC, the Steam client software must be installed, logged into your Steam account, and running in the background. **Steam download manager** handles verifying your license and coordinating the download of game files from Valve's servers. Games are encrypted and can only be unlocked and run through using your Steam account credentials validated by the installed client.
While you can purchase and add games to your Steam library through the web store without Steam installed locally, the client handles decrypting game files during installation and verifying the license is still active each time you launch a game. Without the client handling this license check and download coordination process, the games simply will not function properly or potentially at all.
### Shared PC Access with Multiple Steam Accounts
If your PC is shared between multiple Steam users, having Steam installed allows each account easy access to their own game libraries. When one account logs in, their full library of purchased and installed games will be visible to download and play. Any game tiles marked as "installed" can then be launched no problem. 
Games shown as still needing to be installed but are in the logged in user's library can now begin downloading. Meanwhile, any games in another user's library but not installed yet will bring up the store page, allowing that second user to purchase a license if desired as well. This shared access grants each person convenient access to their digital game collections through a single Steam installation.
### DLC Access May Depend on Owning Account
One consideration for shared PCs involves how downloadable content (DLC) access is handled between Steam accounts on the same machine. In some cases, DLC purchased for a game by one user's account can potentially also be used when another user on the PC launches that game. **Cross-platform DLC functionality** allows everyone access to additional content paid for previously.
However, other games take a more restrictive approach and only permit DLC access to the specific account that funded the downloadable purchase. The alternative account would need to obtain the DLC separately if wanting to make use of those extra features and items when playing. It depends on the policies set individually by each game publisher. Being aware of how DLC sharing is treated on a per-game basis is important for shared gaming PCs.
### Sharing Existing Game Files Saves Redownloading 
A practical advantage of Steam is how it facilitates sharing existing game files between PCs on a home network without requiring a full redownload each time. The installation process for most Steam games places the bulk of files into the SteamApps/common folder on the drive. By simply copying this common folder to another system, a base level installation is immediately available there without using any bandwidth.
As long as the target PC also has Steam installed and signed into the account that owns the games' licenses, it will recognize these pre-existing files. It can then use them as the foundation for a compressed installation process that may only need to download a smaller patch file rather than gigabytes worth of the full game again. **File sharing between devices** in this way allows for smooth multi-PC implementation of your Steam library.
### An Example of File Sharing in Practice 
Consider a scenario where one PC was used to purchase and download a four-pack of the game Borderlands during a sale. This provides licenses for four Steam accounts to play cooperatively together. Rather than forcing the other three players to wait hours to days for their own full download, the common file folders were simply copied to their PCs over the home network. 
Once signed into their Steam accounts on those PCs, Borderlands would immediately recognize the existing game files through the **cross-platform cloud saves** functionality. It would then only need a quick validation/patch step before being ready for play. Since Steam saving is synced online anyway, characters and progress would roam between all the cooperating PCs seamlessly. This sharing process streamlined the whole multiplayer setup significantly through file distribution.
### In Summary 
To reiterate the key points, while it is possible to purchase Steam games through their website store without the client installed, the Steam application itself is required locally in order to download, install, and play those games. Steam handles digital rights management, file encryption/decryption, and validation of purchases through its centralized platform. 
Major benefits of using Steam include easy access to your full library when logging into different PCs, optional sharing of existing game files between systems for quicker additional installations, cloud saving and syncing between devices, as well as convenient sharing of downloaded content like DLC in some cases. Proper use of Steam installation, account authentication, and file distribution features allow for flexible and optimized access to your digital game collection wherever you play.
