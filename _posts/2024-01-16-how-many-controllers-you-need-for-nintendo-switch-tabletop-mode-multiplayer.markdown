###  **Connecting Multiple Controllers**  
The Nintendo Switch supports up to 8 controllers connected simultaneously in tabletop mode, matching the capability while docked. A left and right Joy-Con pair counts as a single controller option. Players have flexibility to use either a single Joy-Con in each hand, or connect two Joy-Cons to a grip. Additionally, each player can opt for a Nintendo Pro Controller for a more traditional gaming experience. With these options, groups can find setups accommodating 1 to 8 players.

### **Choosing Your Controllers**
For groups regularly playing tabletop games, purchasing additional controllers beyond the included Joy-Cons offers versatility. A Pro Controller provides a full controller experience at a lower overall cost than buying two extra Joy-Cons separately. **Nintendo Switch controller grips** that include a battery and can charge the Joy-Cons provide added convenience versus the standard grip included with the system. This allows players to concentrate on games without interruption to swap or charge controllers. 
### **Game Controller Requirements Vary**  
The number and type of controllers supported differs depending on the game. Most multiplayer titles can be played with a single Joy-Con or dual Joy-Cons per player. Some simpler games may require just one Joy-Con for each participant. Popular options like Super Mario Odyssey, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and Mario Party all enable single Joy-Con control schemes. On the other hand, 1-2-Switch was designed for each player to use one Joy-Con separately. Being aware of individual game specifications helps groups pick the right setup.
### **Grips Are Not Always Necessary**
While grips provide a more traditional controller feel and help prevent Joy-Con from being accidentally dropped, they are not crucial equipment for tabletop play. Many players enjoy titles just fine using Joy-Cons without grips, sticking them in each hand or placing on a surface. This allows groups flexibility if short a grip, or preference for a lighter control method. Experimenting with different options helps find the most comfortable fit depending on players and game being played.
### **Game-Specific Controller Requirements**  
Even among games enabling single Joy-Con control, preferences may vary. Super Mario Odyssey and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate afford complete gameplay experiences using a single Joy-Con. However, some find dual Joy-Cons provide a better feel, especially for intense Smash battles. Pokemon: Letâ€™s Go supports single Joy-Con or Pro Controller for each player. Mario Party can be fully enjoyed with one Joy-Con in hand, but the mini-games may rely more on dual-Joy Con motions. Understanding individual title nuances aids in choosing the optimal setup.
### **Customize Based on Game Library**
For those building a **Nintendo Switch tabletop multiplayer** game collection, checking controller compatibility ahead of purchases streamlines play sessions. Don't hesitate to seek advice on configurations supporting specific games already owned. Recommendations factor in control schemes best suited to each title and number of anticipated players. With the Switch's flexibility, groups can tailor their controller setup to make the most of their game library together in tabletop mode.
### **Versatile Tabletop Mode Fun**
Out of the box, the Nintendo Switch provides a wealth of options for shared gaming experiences. Families and friends can experiment finding what works best for the games, number of participants, and personal preferences. Tabletop mode transforms the Switch into an activity allowing varied numbers to play together or take turns in the same space. Its versatile controller support means joy for all.
