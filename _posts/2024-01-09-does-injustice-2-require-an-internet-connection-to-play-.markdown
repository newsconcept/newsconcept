### Understanding Game Updates
Game developers regularly release updates for titles like **Injustice 2** to address any bugs or balancing issues that impact the **player experience**. While you can play parts of the game without updating, staying up-to-date is important for the full experience. Updates fix technical problems that could potentially prevent progressing through certain story missions or multiplayer modes. Developers use player feedback and data to identify areas for improvement. Maintaining the latest version through consistent updates ensures a stable and optimized game.

### Assessing Single Player vs. Multiplayer Components  
Most **single player content** in Injustice 2 is accessible without being fully updated. However, updating is recommended to fix important bugs that developers have addressed. **Multiplayer modes** are the aspects that truly require keeping the game updated. Without the latest patches installed, players will be notified that certain online features are unavailable. Additionally, balance changes from updates could affect the mechanics of fighting other players if not synchronized between all accounts. Cooperative gameplay modes also depend on a consistent version for proper functionality across various platforms and devices.
### The Importance of Day One Patches
When a highly anticipated title launches, there is usually a day one patch available for immediate download. These sizable patches aim to resolve major problems that the development team could not fix prior to release date. Given the **scale and complexity** of modern games, it is uncommon for a game to be completely bug-free right out of the box. The day one update ensures a smoother initial experience by fixing critical bugs that could block story progress or cause crashes. Players can begin playing the single player campaign while the patch downloads in the background.
### Benefits of Allowing Background Downloads to Finish  
While starting up a game during an active download is possible, it is best to allow big updates to fully install before diving in. Playing during an install will dramatically slow the internet speeds dedicated to the **download process**. Over time this can result in an unfinished patch lingering partially downloaded. Letting the update completely install in the background avoids having to stop mid-session later to restart or finalize the installation when notified. The console automatically alerts of required updates, so taking the time for background downloads avoids subsequent waiting downtime.
### Verifying Injustice 2's Online Requirements
Based on feedback from the **Injustice 2 community**, the core single player modes and campaign are fully playable without an internet connection. **However, an active online connection** is necessary to access vital features like multiplayer matchmaking, leaderboards, and certain downloadable add-ons. Periodic game updates are also needed to ensure compatibility when facing other players. While the story can be experienced solo, staying updated opens up the full breadth of playable modes and characters available post-launch.
### Benefits of Simultaneous Game Installation and Updating 
When initially installing a new game like Injustice 2 from a disc, it is best to let the entire installation process complete before launching. This includes allowing any available updates to download simultaneously during the install period rather than waiting twice - once to copy game files and again later to patch. Modern consoles are designed to utilize idle bandwidth efficiently for background tasks. Kicking off both tasks together ensures the fastest path to being ready to play with the most up-to-date version without delay.
### Heeding Console Warnings About Online Access
If a player chooses not to install an update, the system will provide clear notifications about any restricted access as a result. This transparency helps understand what exactly requires being fully patched versus content still playable solo. Most single player elements do not demand the latest version. But certain extras or leaderboards integrating global competitiveness across platforms do rely on synchronization between all users. Heeding the guidance avoids frustration from features unexpectedly locked without realizing an update was needed.
### Weighing Factors For Deciding to Update
When a new patch is available, it is worth considering personal preferences and habits around **single player only gameplay versus online modes**. If strictly enjoying the story solo, waiting less critical compared to wanting to compete online. Other factors like internet speed and time available also impact the decision. Faster connections make downloading less of a burden. Busy schedules mean opting-in upfront versus waiting. Balancing priorities helps optimize the experience whether choosing to update immediately or safeguard local-only enjoyment first before synchronizing later.
