## **Sega's Saturn Dominates The Mid-1990s Without PlayStation Competition** 
### **Video game console market leader without Sony challenge**
In 1994, Sony considered entering the emerging 32-bit game console space but ultimately decided against it. This decision removed what would become their flagship **PlayStation console** from the market. Without PlayStation, Sega's Saturn experienced **no serious third-party competition** in its early years and was the **clear market leader** in the mid-1990s over Nintendo's 64-bit Nintendo 64 console, which was not released until late 1996.

### **Saturn's library expands with hit games** 
With PlayStation absent, more third-party developers focused their efforts on the Saturn platform. **Final Fantasy VII**, instead of being a smash hit exclusive for Sony, came to the Saturn and became the must-have **JRPG of 1997**. Other popular Saturn-exclusive titles of the period included **Sonic the Hedgehog**, **Panzer Dragoon**, and **Virtua Fighter**. Sega's first-party titles performed very well and helped cement the Saturn's position as the top-selling console through 1996 and 1997. 
### **Nintendo 64 struggles to gain ground against Saturn**  
When Nintendo released its N64 console in late 1996, the Saturn had already established a large installed base and library of hits. While Nintendo scored hits with launching titles like **Super Mario 64** and **The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time**, the Saturn held on to its lead with a more diverse selection of games like RPGs and fighting games. By the end of 1997, industry analysts pointed to the Saturn as the clear sales leader with over 25 million consoles sold worldwide and third-party support remaining strong.
## **Saturn Continues Dominance As 32-Bit Era Winds Down**
### **3DO and CD-i abandon console market**
Other mid-1990s consoles like 3DO and CD-i failed to gain traction and both companies exited the hardware business by 1998. This removed competing platforms and allowed existing 32-bit consoles like Saturn and N64 to further extend their lifecycles without new competitors entering the fray. Both Nintendo and Sega were now large, established players firmly in control of the market. 
### **Saturn sales top 50 million globally** 
Riding high on hits from 1997, Saturn sales grew even larger in 1998 topping 50 million units sold worldwide. New exclusive titles increased the attach rate, with breakouts like **Sonic Adventure** demonstrating the Saturn's potential for **3D platformers**. Saturn also remained dominant in the **JRPG genre** with releases from series like **Final Fantasy**, **Dragon Quest**, and **Shin Megami Tensei**.
### **N64 struggles to catch Saturn despite exclusive hits**
By late 1998, the Saturn had maintained a consistent lead globally over the N64, which could not replicate the Saturn's third-party and JRPG support. Blockbuster Nintendo-published games like **The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time** and **Super Smash Bros.** were not enough to close the sizeable gap, and industry analysts forecast the Saturn remaining the top console into the next generation.
## **Saturn's Success Continues Into The New Millennium** 
### **Sega announces new "Katana" 128-bit console** 
In mid-1999, Sega announced plans for the next-generation "Katana" 128-bit system to succeed the Saturn, slated for a late 2000 release. However, Sega pledged continuing support for the Saturn, which was nearing 70 million units sold worldwide and showing no signs of slowing down yet. Critics remarked this was a savvy strategy to maximize Saturn sales in the run-up to Katana.
### **Saturn sales surpass N64 as 128-bit era draws near** 
through early 2000, the Saturn maintained momentum with a steady stream of new games. Long-expected blockbusters like **Shenmue** delivered and helped the Saturn finally surpass sales of the N64, which was in the end-stage of its lifecycle. This cemented the Saturn's legacy as the best-selling 32-bit console of all time, with global sales reaching over 80 million units. 
### **Sega focuses on Katana while supporting Saturn legacy**  
As 2000 began, Sega began ramping up marketing for the autumn 2000 launch of Katana while also delivering final first-party projects for Saturn like **Sonic Adventure 2**. Industry commentators assessed that without disruption from Sony, Sega had solidified its place at the top of the console market heading into the 128-bit generation. The Saturn's legacy seemed sure to influence Katana's early success.
## **Immediate And Long-Term Industry Ramifications**
### **Third-party publishers adjust strategies without PlayStation**  
With over 100 million Saturns sold, third-party publishers reoriented strategies away from strong PlayStation support in our timeline. Companies instead focused extensively on the Saturn to target its massive installed base. Saturn saw more third-party exclusives or games that spent longer as timed exclusives. The balance of power within the industry shifted toward Sega.
### **Sony likely exits game hardware, doubles down on software**  
Sony's decision not to release PlayStation makes it highly improbable they would have ever entered the console market. Without a foothold in gaming, it is plausible Sony would have entirely abandoned game console production to instead focus on other divisions like music and films. They may have tried to become a major third-party publisher for Saturn and Katana games instead.  
### **Nintendo adapts but remains a player, Sega leads new generation**  
Nintendo managed to carve out space with the N64's exclusives in our scenario, but could not rival the Saturn's dominance. For the 128-bit era, Nintendo would have had to rework strategies to remain competitive against Sega. With over 100 million Saturns sold, Sega's Katana launched as the leader in the new generation. The success of Saturn also butterfly effects how other competitors may have emerged.
## **Speculating On Today's Alternative Gaming Landscape** 
### **Sega still leads but other players have emerged**
Had the Saturn been as dominant as PlayStation into the new millennium, Sega likely would still be the market leader in consoles today. However, new competitors almost certainly would have emerged to challenge them as the market expanded globally. Perhaps other companies like Microsoft or newcomers saw opportunities that Sony missed. 
### **Japanese influence remains but Western appeal grows** 
The Saturn's strong support for JRPGs and other Japanese-led genres means that style of game may retain greater influence in this timeline's present. However, as the market broadened, more "Western" blockbusters from multi-national publishers could also have risen to match global demand. A hybridization of influences seems probable.
### **Familiar franchises evolve differently without PlayStation** 
Major series that were PlayStation flagship titles in our timeline, like God of War, Uncharted or Horizon, may have followed completely different creative paths or even been launched on other consoles. Iconic games from Naughty Dog, Sucker Punch, and Guerrilla Games could have transformed established Saturn properties instead. New possibilities are endless.
In summary, without PlayStation the gaming industry's history would be dramatically altered from the mid-1990s onward. Sega's Saturn might have emerged as the industry's long-term market leader through continuous innovation. While uncertainties remain around new competitors and franchises, one reality is clear - a world where PlayStation never existed.
