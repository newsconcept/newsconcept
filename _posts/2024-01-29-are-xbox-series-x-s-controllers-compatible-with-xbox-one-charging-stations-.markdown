###Introduction
The new Xbox Series X|S controllers introduced some subtle changes that may impact compatibility with existing Xbox One charging stations. While the core functions are largely the same across generations, let's take a deeper look at the physical and electronic differences to understand compatibility in more detail. 
###Physical Design Differences
At first glance, the Xbox Series X|S controllers seem nearly identical to their Xbox One predecessors. However, closer inspection reveals a few tweaks to components like the **bumpers, trigger grips, analog thumbsticks,** **_D-pad_**, and addition of a **Share button.** Perhaps most notably, Microsoft ditched the micro-USB port for the modern USB-C on the new controllers. Despite appearance similarities, these physical alterations do not hinder usage across Xbox systems. 
###Battery Compartment Variances 
Underneath the casing, a modified battery compartment houses power in Series X|S controllers. Specifically, the plastic clips retaining **AA batteries** are repositioned compared to Xbox One models. Further, the compartment itself has a slightly altered internal profile. As a result, existing **Xbox One replacement batteries** will not fit properly in next-gen controllers. 
###Micro-USB Compatibility Issues
While the physical port upgrade to USB-C brings conveniences, it creates incompatibilities with older charging peripherals. Namely, Xbox One charging stations relying on micro-USB connectivity are not suitable due to the port mismatch. Adapters may resolve this, but come with potential connection reliability downsides versus a native port solution.
###Drop-In Charger Compatibility 
An option to maintain compatibility between controller generations involves using cross-compatible AA batteries. Specifically, batteries compatible with **Xbox Series X|S controllers _and_ Xbox One controllers** can power both when inserted into drop-in style charging docks. This allows continued use of existing charging stations.
###Continued Xbox One Controller Function
Though minor upgrades exist, Xbox One controllers experience no diminished functionality on newer Xbox hardware. As such, existing charging docks remain perfectly adequate for powering Xbox One controllers during gameplay on Xbox Series X|S consoles. Backwards compatibility eases the transition between console generations. 
###Adaptability Through Third Parties  
Thankfully, third party accessories manufacturers are already addressing compatibility concerns through multipurpose charging solutions. For example, some hubs accommodate both micro-USB and USB-C connections to charge Xbox One and Series X|S controllers interchangeably. These universal products help extend the usable lifespan of existing Xbox charging gear.
###Conclusion
In the end, the Xbox Series X|S controller alterations necessitate some adjustments but do not preclude continued compatibility in all cases. With options like cross-compatible AA batteries, charging adapters, universal docks, and dual-port stations, gamers need not entirely replace worthwhile Xbox One peripherals. With a bit of flexibility, owners can smoothly transition charging between console generations.
