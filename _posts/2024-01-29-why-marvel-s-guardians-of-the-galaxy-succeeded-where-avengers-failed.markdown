### **Marvel Avengers Commercial Flopped Despite High Hopes**  
Marvel's Avengers was highly anticipated given the immense popularity of the Avengers franchise but failed to meet commercial expectations. Despite launching with similar developer backing and publisher support as Guardians of the Galaxy, many doubted Guardians could succeed where Avengers had disappointed.

### **Engrossing Story and Memorable Characters Won Fans**
While Avengers struggled to develop its namesake heroes, Guardians of the Galaxy benefited from a heartfelt narrative that authentically realized each Guardian. Players grew attached to the ragtag group through meaningful character arcs that explored their diverse backgrounds and evolving relationships. Memorable scenes and witty dialogue between the Guardians made them impossible not to love.
### **Ditching a Live Service Model Paid Off**  
Where Avengers leaned too heavily on a repetitive live service structure, Guardians opted for a purely story-driven single-player experience. Without the pressure of live ops or microtransactions, Eidos Montreal could focus entirely on crafting an exciting narrative adventure. Players thrilled at exploring colorful planets without distractions from in-game purchases or grinding.
### **Overestimating Avengers But Underestimating Guardians**
Despite Spider-Man's massive success, Square Enix rushed Avengers into an unfinished live service model before understanding the marketplace. Meanwhile, they doubted unknown Guardians characters could find mainstream popularity. But by faithfully adapting the beloved films, Guardians captured new fans with its heart and hilarity just as it had on the big screen.
### **Tedious and Frustrating Avengers Combat**
With endless waves of robotic enemies in dull environments, Avengers grew wearisome over time. Repetitive combat lacked variety despite its depth of character abilities and customization. Even casual onlookers found gameplay tedious due to uninspired enemy encounter design. In contrast, Guardians offered refreshing combat scenarios around every corner.
### **Rewarding Exploration in Guardians**  
While Avengers pushed microtransactions, Guardians rewarded curiosity and completion through natural unlocks. Finding secrets or conquering side objectives granted new abilities and insights into the Guardians' backstories. Progress always felt achieved, not bought. Players happily immersed themselves in the rich lore rather than feeling pressured to spend.  
### **Authentically Adapting Beloved Guardians**
By prioritizing the Guardians' signature banter and dynamics, Eidos Montreal delivered a faithful adaptation fans loved. Interactions felt genuinely pulled from the films. Avengers struggled more to feel authentic to the well-established MCU versions of beloved heroes like Iron Man or Captain America whose portrayals fell flat.
### **Expanding Guardians Popularity**  
Where doubts surrounded an unknown Guardians property, the game proved a risk that paid off for both Marvel and players. It introduced new fans to the cosmic teamâ€™s appeal while deepening attachment among existing Guardians lovers. Its quality adaptation expanded the franchise's playerbase on an unprecedented scale. 
### **Lessons for Avengers' Redemption**  
To regain goodwill after stumbling out of the gate, Avengers needs major adjustments to both monetization and moment-to-moment fun. But Guardians demonstrates a dedicated single-player experience centered on faithful adaptation and enjoyment can still deliver hits even for relatively unknown intellectual property. With effort, Avengers may one day appeal again too.
