## Introduction
Sony has finally added the long-requested ability for PlayStation Network (PSN) users to change their online ID. After years of users requesting this feature, gamers can now modify their PSN ID as many times as they want through either their PS4 console or the PlayStation website. 
While this new option gives players more control over their online identity, there are some important considerations to keep in mind. This guide will cover the various steps and processes involved in changing your PSN ID, along with limitations, potential issues, and additional tips.
## Changing Your ID Through the PS4 Console
The easiest and most straightforward way to modify your PSN ID is directly through your PS4. To begin, sign into your PlayStation account and navigate to **Settings > Account Management > Account Information > Profile > Online ID**. 
From here, you will be prompted to enter your new desired ID. PlayStation will then display any games or services that may experience issues with the ID change. You have the option to continue or cancel the process from this screen. Assuming you go forward, the system will go through the steps to update your ID across your profile and linked accounts. **This could take up to an hour depending on your download and save data.**
Once complete, you will sign out and back into PSN with your new ID attached to your profile. Your gaming and trophy progress, downloaded games, and subscription services like PlayStation Plus will remain intact.
### Displaying Your Previous ID 
For up to 30 days after changing your ID through the PS4, you have the option to simultaneously display both your new and previous IDs. This lets others still recognize your gamertag while you transition to the new name. To toggle this setting, head back to the **Online ID** section in account settings.

## Changing Your ID Through a Web Browser 
For those preferring to modify their PSN ID from a computer, laptop, or mobile device, the PlayStation website provides an identical option. First, go to www.playstation.com and sign into your account. Then, select **"PSN Profile"** in the top menu and click **"Edit"** next to your current ID.
Similar to the console process, you can enter your new preferred name. PlayStation will list any potential issues based on your games/services before finalizing the change. Expect the steps to sync across devices to again take about an hour afterwards. As with the console, your profile data and subscriptions remain fully intact during and after the modification.
### Contacting PlayStation Support
In rare cases, network or system errors may occur that prevent the ID change from processing fully through either the console or website methods outlined above. If this happens to you, do not worry - simply contact PlayStation Support for assistance. 
Through live chat, email, or phone support, an agent can investigate what went wrong and directly update the database as needed. They have tools available to resolve change issues and get you using your new ID without problems.
## Important Considerations for Changing Your ID
While the new PSN ID change option provides more flexibility, there are a few key notes of awareness to keep in mind both before and after modifying your name:
### Platform Limitations
While changes can be made through PS4 and online, **your ID cannot be altered on PS3 or PlayStation Vita systems**. These older platforms will still display your original ID.
### Child Account Restrictions  
**PlayStation users under 18 have their ID change ability restricted** by parental controls. Only a parent can initiate an ID modification for a child's PSN profile.
### Game Compatibility Issues
Not all games, especially much older titles, were programmed with the option to fully update a user's display name. **Some games may experience bugs, glitches or even lost saved data** because of an ID change. 
### Optional 30-Day Display of Previous ID
As mentioned earlier, you have the choice post-change to simultaneously have both your new and **old ID visible to others for a month** as you transition identically online. 
## Additional Potential Hassles to be Aware of
Aside from the above key points, there are some less common but still possible irritations worth knowing about before modifying your PSN ID:
### Leaderboards and Communities 
Depending on the individual game, your updated name may not immediately sync or display correctly on all **in-game leaderboards and multiplayer lobbies**. This could cause brief confusion.
### Friend Notification Issues  
The PSN ID change has a chance to cause temporary glitches for how notifications and **online status appears to friends on your Friends List**. Problems should resolve themselves within a few hours.
### Special Characters Restrictions
Unlike gamertags on consoles like Xbox, PSN IDs **cannot contain spaces, special symbols or characters beyond alphanumeric text**. This may limit creative name options. 
### Twitch and YouTube Sync Problems
Any link between your PSN ID and profiles on services like Twitch and YouTube may experience minor syncing hiccups since the **name change isn't automatic across all platforms and services**. Manual updates may be needed.
## Tips for Changing Your ID Successfully
To ensure as smooth an experience as possible when modifying your PSN online handle, follow some best practices: 
### Back Up Saved Game Data
Regardless of any listed game incompatibilities, it's always smart to back up your **game saves to an external USB drive or PlayStation Plus cloud storage** before initiating an ID change as a precaution.
### Inform Friends of the Change Ahead of Time  
Let your PSN friends know through messaging that you plan to update your ID so they're not confused by the alteration and still recognize you online.
### Consider the Change Carefully
Double check that the name you want will be one you're happy using going forward, as **you can only change your ID once every 6 months for $10** after the initial free modification. 
### Test in Popular Multiplayer Games
Take some time post-change to test playing and interacting with friends in your most frequently accessed online multiplayer titles to ensure everything, like voice chat, works as intended with the new ID attached to your profile. 
## Reverting Back to a Previous PlayStation ID
If after modifying your PSN ID you end up deciding the new name isn't for you after all, Sony offers the ability to revert back to your old identifier free of charge. However, this option to undo a change must be done by **contacting live PlayStation Support via phone, email or online chat**.
A support associate will need to manually update your profile back in the system database. While reverting is complimentary, wait times for live assistance may vary depending on current call volume. So only request to go back if you're absolutely sure the earlier name is preferred over the newer option tried.
## Conclusion
With the addition of PSN ID changes, PlayStation Network users finally have more flexibility to control their online identity across games and services. Just be mindful of potential compatibility issues for old games as well as limitations on platforms like PS3. 
Preparing by backing up saves, notifying friends, carefully picking a name you'll be happy with long-term, testing multiplayer, and contacting support if issues arise will help your transition go as smoothly as possible. With a little planning and caution, gamers can now easily tailor their PSN profile name to their liking.
