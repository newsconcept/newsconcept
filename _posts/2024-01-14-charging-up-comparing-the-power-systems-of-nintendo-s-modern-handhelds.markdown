The Nintendo Switch and 3DS family of handheld game consoles offer hours of portable gaming fun. However, these devices require power to stay alive on the go. **Nintendo Switch charging technology** and **3DS family charging methods** differ greatly between the systems. Let's break down the charging specifications and compare battery life for the Switch and each 3DS model.
#### The Nintendo Switch Powers Up with USB-C
The Nintendo Switch introduced in 2017 marked Nintendo's return to home console-handheld hybrid gaming. To keep up with modern portable technology, Nintendo equipped the Switch with **USB Type-C charging**. Using a standard USB-C port allows the Switch to charge from any compatible power source. Gamers simply need a USB-C to USB-C cable to connect the included AC adapter or an external battery pack to their Switch. 
The Switch AC adapter delivers enough wattage at 15V/1.8A or 15V/3A to rapidly replenish the Switch's internal battery pack while playing graphically intensive games. On a single charge, players can expect the Switch battery to last between 2-6.5 hours depending on the game being played and screen brightness settings. Lengthier sessions exhausting that power can be extended by continuing to charge through USB-C while gaming.

#### Older 3DS Models Stick with Proprietary Ports
Where the Switch moved forward with the flexible USB standard, the original **Nintendo 3DS, 3DS XL, and Nintendo 2DS** relied on proprietary charging ports rather than USB. These early 3DS models used a specialized 3DS-style port requiring the included Nintendo AC adapter and original 3DS charging cable for wired power. 
This unique 3DS charging connector made the systems incompatible with standard USB cables and chargers of the time. Owners needed to carry the dedicated Nintendo charging gear to replenish these first-generation 3DS batteries on the go. However, the proprietary technology did allow Nintendo tight control over the handheld's functions and security.
#### New Nintendo 3DS Gains Optional microUSB Charging
Recognizing the growing preference for universal charging standards, Nintendo updated the design of the **New Nintendo 3DS** in 2014. While retaining compatibility with original 3DS gear through its proprietary port, the New 3DS also added the option to charge via microUSB. This opened up the ability to use standard microUSB cables and chargers as an alternative to the dedicated Nintendo power supply.
With a full charge attained either through the 3DS port or microUSB, battery life on the New 3DS and 2DS averaged around 3-5 hours for portable game play. Video playback could stretch the battery slightly longer to around 5-7 hours on a single charge. Overall battery performance saw only slight improvements over the earlier 3DS models.
#### Incompatibility Between Switch and 3DS Charging Methods
The key difference in Nintendo's Switch and 3DS charging technologies becomes clear: **the Switch follows the modern standard of USB-C whereas 3DS uses either a proprietary connector or optional microUSB**. This incompatibility means gamers cannot charge their Switch using old 3DS gear or vice versa. 
Only the Switch and USB-C compliant power sources are a compatible match. 3DS owners need the original Nintendo AC adapters designed for their particular model plus correct replacement charging cables. With such different charging port standards applied, direct charging interchangeability between the Switch and 3DS is simply not possible.
#### Understanding the Power Specs Behind Each System  
To efficiently recharge built-in battery packs, Nintendo equipped the AC adapters for both the Switch and various 3DS models with tailored power delivery specs. The Switch power supply provides higher voltage at 15V and current range of 1.8A or 3A to rapidly replenish the system through USB-C Power Delivery.
In contrast, 3DS adapters offer lower power throughput using older USB standards. Original 3DS power bricks deliver 5V at 800mA through the proprietary port or 5V/1A via microUSB on New 3DS models. These output levels reflect the lesser power demands of the 3DS hardware versus graphically intense Switch games.
#### Summarizing Battery Life For Portable Gaming
Combining portables technology with optimized power delivery allows both the Switch and 3DS handhelds to provide many hours of untethered gameplay. On average, Switch users can play 2-6.5 hours of games on a fully charged battery. Lengthier gaming sessions up to 4.5-9 hours are achievable when using video apps instead of processor-intensive games.
The New 3DS and 2DS models offer similar longevity to the original 3DS line. Three to five hours of game time and upwards of 5-7 hours for video playback is typical from a single battery charge. Overall battery performance remains consistent across the 3DS family while showing room for improvement versus the Switch.
#### Choosing the Right Charging Gear Keeps Games On The Go
In summary, Nintendo adopted different charging strategies for the Switch versus older 3DS portables. The Switch standardized on the future-proof USB-C connection, while 3DS started proprietary then added microUSB as an option. With such dissimilar port technologies, gamers must take care to use only authentic charging accessories designed precisely for their Nintendo handheld. Properly pairing the right charging cable with a supplied AC adapter ensures both systems stay powered up for endless mobile gaming adventures.
