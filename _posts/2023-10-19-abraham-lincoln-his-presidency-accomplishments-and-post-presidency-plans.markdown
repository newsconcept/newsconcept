### Taking Office and Initial Challenges  
Abraham Lincoln delivered an emotional farewell address in Springfield, Illinois on February 11, 1861 before leaving for Washington, D.C. to assume the presidency. Lincoln and the public were aware of the tremendous challenges ahead as tensions between free and slave states were rising.

When he appointed former rivals to his cabinet, they expected to wield power behind the scenes. Despite uncertainties and critics from all sides, Lincoln worked to keep pro-slavery and pro-Union factions united in the fight.

### Border State Policies and Cabinet Challenges
Lincoln skillfully convinced four border states to remain in the Union at a time when many residents supported the Confederacy. **Abraham Lincoln border states Civil War tactics persuasion** Managing factions within his own party proved difficult as well, as his cabinet initially sought more influence than Lincoln allowed. He faced vicious slander from those wanting bolder or more cautious action on slavery. Lincoln remained determined to take gradual steps toward emancipation while preserving the Union. 
### Finding Generals for Victory
Lincoln knew the war demanded decisive military leadership. He relieved several generals from duty until elevating Ulysses S. Grant, William T. Sherman, Philip Sheridan, and George Henry Thomas to commands. **Abraham Lincoln Civil War generals Union victory strategy** Under their direction, Union forces gained momentum and eventually prevailed over the Confederacy on the battlefield.

As the Civil War concluded in 1865, Lincoln had guided the nation through its gravest crisis. **Abraham Lincoln Civil War presidency accomplishments** He earned reelection in 1864 to oversee Reconstruction.

### Post-Presidency Travel Plans
Had Lincoln survived his second term, sources indicate he planned extensive travel before returning to private life in Illinois. **Abraham Lincoln post-presidency plans travel goals** He told his wife Mary of intentions to visit Europe, including Germany and Greece. California's Gold Rush also piqued Lincoln's interest for a western trip. The President hoped to "retire" from public duties and see more of the nation and world and spend time with his family. Tragically, Lincoln was assassinated just days after the Civil War ended, denying him these personal goals and possibilities.
### Legacy and Remembrance  
Even after his untimely death, Lincoln's legacy grew as a leader who preserved the Union and advanced freedom and justice. **Abraham Lincoln legacy Civil War president** He showed vision, wisdom and strength of character by issuing the Emancipation Proclamation and working to pass the 13th Amendment.
