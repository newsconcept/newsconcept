### **PlayStation 3 retro gaming console affordable prices online services** 
Sony's PlayStation 3 was first released back in 2006 and while online services for the console are winding down after over 15 years, the PS3 remains a relatively affordable option for experiencing its large library of classic games. Even with PlayStation Network slated to shut down for the PS3 and PSVita in the near future, the PS3 offers advantages like **retro gameplay, digital media functions, and backwards compatibility** that make it worthwhile to own in 2022.

### Sony extends PSN support shows faith in PS3 user base 
After initially announcing plans to close PlayStation Network for the PS3 and PSVita in Summer 2021, Sony backtracked and committed to keeping the services running for at least another year. This move underscores the interest that remains for the PS3 among hardcore fans looking to download patches, sync trophies, and access online functionality. While sign-ins will soon require two-factor authentication set up through the PlayStation website or mobile app, digital downloads and online features can still be enjoyed. 
Stores are closing for the outdated PSP, but the more capable PS3 continues to be supported with its online backbone intact. The extra year gives fans time to finish games and experience multiplayer/co-op before fully transitioning to newer consoles. It shows Sony still values the dedicated players keeping interest in their **sixth generation console** over 15 years later.
### Bargain prices make building a PS3 collection affordable
With its production run completed, used and refurbished PlayStation 3 consoles can now be found for incredibly low prices. Basic 120GB and 250GB slim models regularly sell between $50-$100 depending on included accessories or games. Larger bundles pushing 500GB-1TB of storage space often come bundled with one or two titles and extras for around $150. 
Game prices have also plummeted to pocket-friendly levels thanks to ample used copies flooding the market. Many mainstream blockbusters like Uncharted, God of War, Killzone, and Gran Turismo can be picked up for under $5. Even collector's editions of major franchises top out around $15-20. With thousands of quality titles across multiple genres, building a robust PS3 library is currently very affordable.
### Dated but good looking games make system worthwhile 
While PS3 visuals can't keep up with modern consoles, later entries hold their own at 1080p resolutions. Major exclusives released between 2011 to the PS3's end in 2015 still offer handsome graphics and production values. **High definition remasters** of acclaimed PS2 games like Ico, Shadow of the Colossus, and Sly Cooper not only enhanced the visuals but packing substantive new content and features. 
Titles like inFAMOUS 2, The Last of Us, God of War Ascension, and Killzone 3 employed the Cell processor to its fullest and hold up favorably against many current-gen indie games. Their polished production retains entertainment value, helping offset the system's age. Graphical shortcomings are outweighed by engaging narratives, stylish art direction, and thrilling gameplay mechanics that pushed the PS3 hardware.
### Backwards compatibility expands classic game choices
A major edge the PS3 retains over other retro options is its partial backwards compatibility. Original "fat" PS3 models play both PS1 and PS2 discs right out of the box, providing access to thousands of classics on one device. While the smaller SKUs dropped the PS2 hardware, all PlayStation 3s run PS1 discs flawlessly. 
From fan-favorite JRPGs like Final Fantasy VII and IX to 3D platformers like Ratchet & Clank and Jak & Daxter, the sprawling back-catalog makes for endless gaming entertainment. Sports, fighting, and adventure games from the older eras also received **high definition remasters** on PS3, offering modernized visuals with saving/trophy support integrated. This expansive selection alongside modern PS3 games provides incredible value and variety.
### Affordable media entertainment hub for whole family 
Beyond games, the PS3 delivered as a full-fledged home entertainment system. It plays standard DVDs and newer Blu-Ray discs out of the box, providing high quality playback of movies and television. Major firmware updates added critical support for common media file types as well, letting users enjoy personal videos, photos, and music through simple drag-and-drop to the hard drive. 
Additional storage was also easily expandable via affordable USB hard drives or thumb drives, allowing for terabytes of extra movies, music videos, and TV shows. Multiple users could be set up to have personalized libraries too. These functions gave the PS3 utility beyond just gaming well into the Smart TV era. 
Its abilities to seamlessly integrate **premium packaged media and personal digital files** delivered incredible value as a universal entertainment device. Even today, core media playing remains more robust than on newer PlayStation systems still lacking universal USB file support and storage expansion.
### Retro charm with modern conveniences 
While original hardware and loose discs provide the authentic retro experience, the PS3 editions modernized the classics significantly. Remastered games offered options like smooth frame rates, trophy support, shareability, online multiplayer, and control scheme improvements. Being able to boot games from the integrated hard drive or discs also gave a cleaner frontend than swapping discs on older hardware.
For collectors, tracking down niche PlayStation classics remains most authentic. But the PS3 versions deliver the games' essence while removing outdated technical limitations. Conveniences like consistent frame rates and reduced loading times enhanced the experience. 
Digital purchases of PSone and PS2 classics on PSN further streamlined the process, keeping libraries portable without discs. Co-op and competitive online play through PlayStation Network extended genres like fighting and adventure games. These quality of life enhancements ensured the retro games remained constantly enjoyable for modern audiences.
### Affordable path to experiencing Sony's console legacy
While the PS3 is facing an inevitable online sunset, many of its advantages as a multimedia device and gateway to PlayStation's past will endure. Even after online services cease, it can still play countless Blu-rays, DVDs, digital videos, photos and music through simple USB/hard drive support. 
Its library of remastered PSone/PS2 classics and high-quality PS3 exclusives provides hundreds of great games to play both solo and with communities through unofficial means. At its bargain bin prices, no other device can deliver such robust backwards compatibility and entertainment functionality for the entire family. 
As interest grows in PlayStation's rich history and sixth-generation era, the PS3 remains one of the most cost-effective paths to experience this significant period. Its reputation as a powerhouse home console and treasure trove of acclaimed franchises is as valid as ever.
# Why the PlayStation 3 is still worth owning in 2022
The PlayStation 3 has remained a relevant and worthwhile gaming investment long after its production ended, thanks to an immense library held back by the test of time. Even as online services wind down and newer hardware takes center stage, the PS3 endures as an affordable portal to gaming history and home entertainment versatility that Sony's newer systems still lack. For dedicated fans and families alike, grabbing a used PS3 in 2022 delivers phenomenal value and accessibility to PlayStation's past.
