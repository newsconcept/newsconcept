### Rockstar Announces the End of an Era
Rockstar Games recently shocked gamers by announcing that **Grand Theft Auto Online server support for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 will conclude on December 16, 2021.** This marks the end of an incredible eight-year journey for one of the most popular and profitable multiplayer games in history on last-gen consoles.

### A Lengthy Run That Can't Last Forever
Launched back in October 2013, **GTA Online brought the chaotic open-world mayhem of Los Santos to PS3 and Xbox 360 users online.** Through the highs and lows, **Rockstar continued regular major support and new content for the game well past the lifespan of their original hardware.** With millions of players racked up across both platforms, the game truly stood the test of time. However, all good things must come to an end.
### New Beginnings Demand New Hardware
While the single-player story mode stories of Grand Theft Auto V will live on indefinitely for last-gen owners, **continuing the Online experience requires a compatible platform after December.** This means those still playing on PS3 or Xbox 360 will need to upgrade to either a PS4, Xbox One, or gaming PC to keep causing mayhem with friends. For many, this also means repurchasing a new copy of the game. 
### Los Santos Tuners Was the Grand Finale 
Released in July 2021, **the "Los Santos Tuners" update brought a massive new garage, cars and customization to the Online world.** It proved to be Rockstar's biggest and most ambitious post-launch content ever for the 8-year-old game. Looking back, it seems this served as the perfect sendoff for last-gen versions before next-gen became the focus.
### Story Mode Remains - Online Moves On
While December's shutdown spells the end for GTA Online on PS3 and Xbox 360, **solo players need not worry as story mode experiences will still be fully accessible offline.** Hundreds of hours of criminal escapades across Los Santos and Blaine County will live on for those yet to complete them. It's just the always-online components that are saying goodbye. 
### Next-Gen Opens Wonderful New Doors
With last-gen versions now in the rearview mirror, **Rockstar is liberated to unleash their full next-gen creative vision.** Upcoming new platforms allow for even more visual feats and sophisticated online experiences than ever before. This December's change paves the way for an exciting new generation of the massively popular GTA Online.
### March Cannot Come Soon Enough
One highly-anticipated next-gen outing is the **upgraded version of GTA V labeled "Expanded and Enhanced" hitting PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on March 15, 2022.** Rumored to boast technologial flourishes like enhanced graphics, lighting, weather and more across the entire package. A true next-gen overhaul is certainly incentive enough for current players to take the hardware plunge.
### Online Will Never Be the Same 
While the always-online nature of GTA Online continues as a requirement, **new generation-defining features are also part of the plan.** Sources indicate the possibility of expanded player counts in free roam lobbies, additional activities with friends, and a whole new level of chaos thanks to more sophisticated backend netcode. The future is poised to be bigger and badder than ever before online in Los Santos.
### A Bittersweet End Leads to Exciting New Horizons
After nearly a decade of criminal adventures, bidding farewell to the old generation of GTA Online is melancholic yet promising. **While some dear memories will remain exclusive to last-gen, the new year holds potential for modern technical wizardry to reinvent the experience.** With change comes opportunity, so now all eyes look ahead towards a even more impressive online saga's next thrilling chapter.
