## Microsoft's Misguided Vision Sets the Stage for Failure
### **Overreaching DRM and Entertainment-Focused Policies Doomed the Xbox One from the Start**
When Microsoft first unveiled their vision for the next-generation Xbox One console at E3 2013, they emphasized expansive digital rights management policies and transforming the device into an all-encompassing home entertainment system over its core gaming functionality. Policies such as requiring an always-online internet connection, prohibiting resale of pre-owned games, and restrictions on sharing libraries with friends were meant to push their digital marketplace approach but served only to greatly annoy dedicated gamers. By prioritizing integrated TV, multimedia and restrictive licensing controls over the gameplay experiences fans expected from its predecessor, Microsoft had badly misread gaming's core audience and what truly resonates with them.
