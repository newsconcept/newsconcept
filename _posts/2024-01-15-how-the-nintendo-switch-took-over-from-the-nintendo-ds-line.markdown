The Nintendo DS handheld was a juggernaut during its lifespan, but after over a decade on the market its successor — the Nintendo Switch — arrived and ultimately replaced it. Here's a deeper look at how the Switch surpassed the DS.
### **The Incredible Run of the Nintendo DS Family**
The original Nintendo DS launched in 2004 and was an immediate success thanks to its dual-screen design and innovative touchscreen. Over the years, numerous upgraded models released like the DS Lite, DSi, and DSi XL. Throughout its lifetime, the DS lineup sold over 154 million units worldwide, making it the best-selling handheld of all time. Its library expanded to thousands of great games across many genres. For over a decade, the DS provided portable gaming bliss.

### **The Switch Introduced a Whole New Style of Portable Gaming** 
When Nintendo unveiled the Switch in 2017, it offered something brand new - a console that could be played on televisions as well as taken on the go as a portable system. This hybrid design let users enjoy games wherever and however they wanted. The Switch's revolutionary Joy-Con controllers also allowed for versatile local multiplayer. Coupled with improved hardware specs over the DS, the Switch seemed primed to advance portable gaming to new heights.
### **Massive Blockbuster Franchises Came to the Switch**
With its hybrid nature, the Switch attracted many top third-party developers and publishers. This resulted in major series coming to the platform. Beloved franchises like The Legend of Zelda, Mario, Pokémon, Splatoon, Xenoblade Chronicles, and more received new Switch entries. Indie darlings also flocked to the eShop. This diverse library of new and old IPs excited many gamers to make the Switch their primary system.
### **Online Play Became a Priority on the Switch** 
While the DS had rudimentary online via accessories, the Switch built robust online functionality directly into the system. This included online multiplayer, voice chat, and the ability to link up with friends worldwide whether docked or portable. Nintendo also launched its paid online service featuring classic games. Suddenly, fully participating in the online community was easy. This emphasis on connectivity gave the Switch a significant edge over the aging DS infrastructure.
### **Indie Developers Found a Welcoming Home on the Switch**
Thanks to its reasonably accessible dev tools and growing install base, the Switch became extremely fertile ground for **independent game developers**. Enticed by the opportunity to reach many active users, indies flocked to the platform in droves. This flood of creative, outside-the-box titles greatly expanded the Switch's library and kept things fresh between the major releases. The eShop became stocked with charming downloads - a stark contrast to the DS's later years focused mostly on ports and remakes.
### **Enhanced Portability and Battery Life Made the Switch Even More Appealing** 
While the DS had respectable battery life for its era, the Switch took portable endurance to another level. Whether playing for hours docked or undocked, the Switch's improved energy efficiency allowed non-stop gaming sessions that gamers of all ages could appreciate. Long flights, road trips and commutes were never a problem. Plus, the Switch's sleeker design made it highly transportable for on-the-go play. These upgrades established the Switch as the ideal modern handheld experience.  
### **Nostalgic DS Fans Had One Last Hurrah with Remakes**
As the DS transitioned out over time, Nintendo ensured longtime fans felt appreciated with quality legacy content. Faithful remasters like Bowser's Inside Story + Bowser Jr.'s Journey and The World Ends with You: Final Remix brought classic DS RPGs to new audiences with enhanced visuals and bonus features. These nostalgic ports recaptured players' memories while keeping the DS spirit alive during its final years. They served as a nice send off for those who grew up with Nintendo's storied dual-screen handheld.
### **The Switch Dominated as the Go-To Platform for All Gamers** 
By late 2020, after over 150 million DS systems sold, Nintendo quietly discontinued new DS console production to focus fully on the Switch. With its superior power, engaging first-party games, versatile design, and thriving online ecosystem, the Switch emerged as the new go-to platform for any type of player. From hardcore to casual, the Switch was the must-have system. Although it could never replace the DS's legacy, the Switch more than lived up to its promise of ushering in the future of portable entertainment. Its success signified not just the end of an era for Nintendo handhelds, but the start of an exciting new chapter.
