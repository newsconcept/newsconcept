### A Promising Start With Room for Growth
Backwards compatibility has been a priority for Microsoft with their Xbox consoles, but fully supporting thousands of legacy games comes withchallenges. The Xbox Series X promises the "best backwards compatibility" yet, so let's take a deeper look at how it stacks up against past efforts andwhat may still need to be done.

### Leveraging the Xbox One Foundation 
The **Xbox Series X launch library** will include any Xbox and Xbox 360 games already playable on the Xbox One. By building off the One's emulation work, Microsoft is able to deliver a larger starting catalog than previous gens. However, the Series X is currently meant to **mimic the backward compatible experience of the One.** While this gets more games running at launch, it may not utilize the new console's full hardware capabilities. 
More processingpower could potentially enable **improved framerates, resolutions or other enhancements** for those legacy titles. But focusing first on compatibility means **further optimizations may come later** through system and title updates. Microsoft's goal is to avoid any **regressions in compatibility** as they refine support. This conservative approach helps ensure a stable experience at launch while keeping options open for future improvements.
### Only a Fraction of the Xbox 360 Library Works
Unfortunately, the scope of backwards compatibility remains limited compared to theoriginal Xbox 360 library size. On Xbox One, onlyaround 30% of Xbox 360 games—632 out of 2,154 total releases—are compatible.This represents just a fraction of **the thousands of games published for Microsoft'sseventh generation console**. Even accounting for unknown licensing or technical blockers, such a small percentage inevitably leaves many fan-favorite titles **stranded without support.** 
### Original Xbox Support Lags Far Behind 
Backwards compatibility for the first Xbox is even more scarce. The Xbox Onecan play only 63 out of the 997 games released for the original console.That's less than 10% compatibility for titles from **Microsoft's debut in thegames industry over two decades ago.** While emulating older hardware is morechallenging, such a sparse library undoubtedly frustratesplayers hoping to revisit this era.
### Legacy Support is an Ongoing Journey
Fully preserving past generations of software remains an iterative processrequiring ongoing effort. By improving on the Xbox One foundation and keepingoptions open, the Xbox Series X takes another step forward. But challengespersist in maintaining compatibility as hardware evolves.Transparency around limitations and strategic investmentscould helpaddress fan dissatisfaction over missing favoritesand build greater trust inMicrosoft's commitment to legacy games.Backwards compatibility will likely remain anarea demanding long-term attention and where room for growthstill exists.
### A Beloved Cult Classic Left Behind
One such missing title is 2005's "The Warriors," a **beat 'em up based on the 1979 film of the same name**. Adapted from a novel, the movie and game told **the story of a New York gang trying to make it back to their neighborhood after being framed for killing a rival leader**. While not a major commercial success, "The Warriors" developed a passionate cult following for its **atmospheric open-world recreation of 1970s New York City** and campy, over-the-top action.
Its absence from backwards compatibility programs is especially bafflinggiven the **game's endurance among fans and its relevance to pop culture history**. Yet on the Xbox digital storefront, its price has steadily **risen over the past few years from $9.99 in mid-2019 to the current $19.99**. Fans hoping to replay this slice of nostalgia face either hunting down **original Xbox disc copies or missing out entirely without backwards compatibility support.** Cases like this highlight how incomplete legacy emulation affects bothsatisfaction and consumer spending on older titles.
### Underpromising and Overdelivering is Needed  
When promoting the expanded backwards compatibility of Xbox Series X, Microsoftclaimed games would work "with some exceptions."However,the **tiny fractions of supported libraries proved this significantlydownplayed the vast number of incompatible titles**. While technical challengesare real, such vaguewording understandablyfedperceptions thecompanywasnotfullytransparentor committed to preserving its catalog.
Going forward, a better approach would be tounderpromisecapabilitiesbutoverdeliver through diligentwork.
